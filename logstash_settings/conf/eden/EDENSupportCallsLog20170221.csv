This meant that there were two separate requests for your company on EDEN linked to your user.

We approved the first request on our system which is when you received the notification to say that your organisation has been approved.
We then rejected the second duplicate request for your company on EDEN and that is why your received the message to say your request had been rejected.

My apologies this was a complete oversight my part when rejecting the duplicate organisation I should of emailed you to advise you of the issue and ask you to ignore that rejection email as your company had already been approved on EDEN.

2015-05-07,,,EPA,EDEN,Email,Marian OBrien,Portal,approve new orgs,,asked  what criteria should we use when deciding whether to approve or reject the request. ,"sent this answer 
I think the best thing to check is if the organisation exists in EDEN under a similar name e.g. company name ltd could be present on EDEN but the user has registers a new organisation  company name limited which if approved would create a second duplicate EDEN organisation.You can check if an organisation exists in EDEN under a similar name by hovering over the �My Account� menu and selecting �Manage Organisations�  when the screen loads you can then do a search for organisations with that name.
If it doesn�t exist on EDEN then I think it is safe to approve it and the organisation will get then get created in EDEN and the user will have access to LMA.The user will then be able to login to EDEN and launch the LMA application but will see nothing unless a licence has been assigned to that organisation in LEMA.Or you could also check LEMA to see if the organisation exists if it does exist with the same name then open the organisation details and check to see if the EDEN SSO Organisation is set to �No�. If it is set to �No� then if when approve the organisation in EDEN will turn this LEMA organisation into an EDEN organisation and the user will then be able to login to EDEN and launch the LMA application but will see nothing unless a licence has been assigned to this organisation in LEMA. If the EDEN SSO Organisation is set to yes then this means that the organisation already exists in EDEN.If the organisation does exist in EDEN under a similar name then it should be rejected but before you can reject the organisation please let us know so we can insert an organisation membership request for the user into the correct organisation.",

As Irish water require this but Converting our LIMS (LABWARE) to report for different requirements poses huge logistical difficulties as significant configuration involving slot of labour and time  something which we have very little of  would be required . ,Checkew with both the UWW team and the Drinking Team. UWW are happy as long as the parameters being reported are what is set ou in the licence which is the case in this matter and the drinking water team carry out the conversion when the samples are downloaded to EPA internal systems and they provided the comment: �If the certificate from the laboratory reports Nitrate Nitrite or Ammonia as N then the sample result should be uploaded to EDEN as N and the result will then be automatically converted to NO2 NO3 or NH4 when downloaded from EDEN. We will still assess the converted result against the limits in the Drinking Water Regulations which are as NO2 NO3 or NH4. There are separate parameter codes in EDEN for Nitrate and N and Nitrate as NO3 (and the other nitrogen compounds) so please make sure to choose the correct parameter code depending on the laboratory cert.� .
