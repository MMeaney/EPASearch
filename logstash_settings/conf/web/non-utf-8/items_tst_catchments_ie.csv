Water is a precious resource and is essential for all life on earth. Looking after our rivers, lakes and coastal waters so they can meet our current and future needs, and also continue to support the ecosystems that depend on them, is vital for Irelandâ€™s future. Doing this at community level is the best way to get people actively involved.

Sharing science and stories about Integrated Catchment Management in Ireland. Integrated Catchment Management is a community-led approach that aims to involve people and groups from across society. 46 Catchments 583 Subcatchments 4829 Waterbodies View Data and Dashboards What is a catchment, and why should you care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other waterbody. We all want to have good quality schools and hospitals in our community, as this can help with enhancing education and health, and overall quality of life. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can help make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like agriculture, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. Find out more Using data to help understand our catchments Managing our catchments effectively requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information. This includes: how people use the land and waterbodies, and what livelihoods are supported; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water flows both above and below ground from where it falls as rain to the sea; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. You can see lots of this information on the Maps and Data pages, which will be added to over time. These pages show information about our 46 catchments, 583 subcatchments and 4829 waterbodies. Many waterbodies have charts available for trends in key biological and chemical indicators, which can help us understand how healthy they are, and the possible causes of any changes. Find out more How to get involved with you local catchment and make a difference today While understanding what is affecting our catchments and waterbodies can help us manage them, experience from projects in Ireland and around the world has shown that local community involvement is one of the keys to long-term success. There are many ways for individuals or local communities to get involved â€“ this can be anything from organising a Spring Clean of a riverbank once a year, getting your local Tidy Towns committee to look at how your river or lake can help your town become a nicer place to live, or even establishing a Rivers Trust or locally led agri-environment scheme to help draw down funding and establish a long term plan for your area. You can sign up for our quarterly Catchments Newsletter using the form at the top of this page, and if you let us know what county you are in, we can contact you with relevant information about anything new that starts in your county. Find out more Survey on septic tanks and your local catchment Weâ€™re currently running a survey on Septic Tanks, and how you relate to your local catchment. Weâ€™d like to use the results of this survey to communicate with local communities better, specifically on the possible health and environmental risk from malfunctioning septic tank systems. All data is anonymous, we do not record your IP address or any other identifying data. You can fill out the survey and find out more at the link below.

Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Stories News Contact Guide to the Water Framework Directive Home Guide to the Water Framework Directive The Water Framework Directive was agreed by all individual EU member states in 2000, and its first cycle ran from 2009-2015. The Directive runs in 6 year cycles, so the 2nd Cycle runs from 2016-2021. Having one Framework for water quality for all of the 4,933 waterbodies in Ireland, and all the others across Europe, allows us to compare our results, and see what works to help us make sure all our surface and ground water achieves at least Good Status, and no deterioration occurs. Rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional water can all have 5 statuses: High Good Moderate Poor Bad Groundwater has just 2 statuses â€“ Good and Poor. Status is assessed under the following headings: Biological Quality Fish Benthic Invertebrates (These are small animals that live at the bottom of a waterbody or in sediment, and have no backbone) Aquatic Plants Hydromorphological Quality â€“ this is how a river flows, and can be affected by river bank structure, river continuity, or the substrate of the river bed. Physical-chemical quality such as temperature, oxygenation and nutrient conditions Chemical quality for specific pollutants, for example XXXXXXX Assessing Status â€“ one out, all out An important point to note is that the rule when assessing the above is one out, all out so if a water body is at Good status in 3 of the above categories, but Poor in the 4th, the entire waterbody is judged to be Low it is the lowest result that determines status. Public Participation A key part of the Water Framework Directive is Article 14, which requires all member states to genuinely engage with the people who live, work and play in a catchment. To do this, it is important to understand how local communities live in their catchments and use their water. Therefore, it is critical that local communities are involved in management and decision making related to protecting and, where necessary, improving their water resources. Ultimately, meeting the sometimes narrow objectives of the WFD is not the aim â€“ helping communities protect and improve a beautiful and diverse landscape with accessible healthy waterways that are productively used to support livelihoods, habitats and rich wildlife is the goal. However, the WFD can be a powerful tool to help in achieving this goal.

Community Involvement Experience around the world and in Ireland has shown that working together in local partnerships with local communities, Rivers Trusts, public bodies, and others on managing individual catchments and subcatchments of a suitable size is the best way to protect and improve our water, and making sure local communityâ€™s livelihoods and health are sustained and protected into the future. Collaboration To effectively manage our catchments, bottom-up and top-down collaboration is necessary. Catchments.ie will highlight stories from around Ireland showing how we can manage our rivers, lakes and coastal waters, and share the science and data that is necessary to help people make decisions. This website has been established by Department of Environment, the Environmental Protection Agency and the new Local Authority Waters and Communities Office, and is designed to function as a hub so any interested citizen can get all the information they need about how to get involved in one place. Understanding Understanding our catchments effectively requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information: how people are using the water, including drinking, agriculture, industrial use and bathing; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water bodies are connected both above and below ground; how the water flows from where it falls as rain to the sea; how people use the land and waterbodies, and what livelihoods are supported; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. You can see lots of this information on the Maps and Data pages, which will be added to over time. Planning To help manage our water, a draft national River Basin Management Plan will be published by December 2016. A full public consultation will take place between December 2016 and December 2017, so you will be able to have your say about what matters to you, and how we should plan for our future.

Home What is a catchment, and why should I care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a waterbody, with all the water ultimately running off to a single outlet. 3D depiction of a catchment We all want to have good quality schools in our local community, and living in the catchment area for a good school can help make sure children get a good education, and even add to the value of your home. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like food production, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. To protect and improve our rivers, lakes and coastal waters, we need to understand how they flow through and are connected with the diverse landscapes that surround them, and what is causing pressure on their ability to support the communities, livelihoods and ecosystems that depend on them for clean and healthy water. On this website, we have broken Ireland up into 46 larger catchments, and 583 subcatchments â€“ meaning that you can find information about your local communityâ€™s catchment easily. Ireland has been divided into 46 catchments We have also included information about what you can do to help your local community look after your water, and the catchment that drains into it. This can be as simple as a spring clean of your riverbank once a year, or something bigger like working on establishing a Locally-led Agricultural Scheme or Rivers Trust for your local community. Working together on these issues at local level has been shown to work around the world, and we have also have stories on the site from across Ireland of those who have developed community initiatives that have helped improve their quality of life, supported local livelihoods, and allowed local ecosystems to flourish.

A guide to the Water Framework Directive This piece of EU legislation has become a major driver for achieving sustainable management of water in Ireland and across the EU. Under this directive, all inland and coastal waters must reach â€˜Goodâ€™ ecological status. â€˜Good ecological statusâ€™ means achieving satisfactory quality water, maintaining ecosystems that can support all the species of plants, birds, fish and animals that live in these aquatic habitats. Having one Framework for water quality for all of the 4,829 waterbodies in Ireland, and all the others across Europe, allows us to compare our results, and see what works to help us make sure all our surface and ground water achieves at least Good Status, and no deterioration occurs. A key part of the Water Framework Directive is Article 14, which requires all member states to genuinely engage with the people who live, work and play in a catchment. Ultimately, meeting the objectives of the Water Framework Directive is not the aim â€“ helping communities protect and improve a beautiful and diverse landscape with accessible healthy waterways that are productively used to support local health, livelihoods, habitats and rich wildlife is the goal. The Water Framework Directive is a powerful tool to help in achieving this. Find out more This site uses cookies: Find out more. Okay, thanks Who is involved?

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Stories News Contact Catchment News Home News Burren LIFE: Farming for Conservation Burren LIFE: Farming for Conservation April 14, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Stories The Burren region, located between Counties Clare and Galway, is a place which has long been recognised for its unusual rocky landscape, its rich wildlife and its fascinating archaeology. As with much of the Irish landscape, the Burren has been shaped over many millennia by the actions of farmers and their livestock. Supporting these farmers to sustain low-input grazing systems is a key challenge if we are to ensure the Burren maintains its exceptional natural and cultural heritage. Burren Life is a locally targeted conservation programme which tries to meet this challenge, using a novel approach which places farmers at the very centre of the conservation agenda and rewarding these farmers for their environmental performance. With 15,000ha currently under management, Burren Life has proven to be very impactful and has received much recognition in recent times for its work. This perhaps belies the fact that the model is based on over 10 years of applied, farm-level research and relationship-building. The initial spark for Burren Life came from a number of local actors, most importantly farmers who felt their voices werent being heard when Special Areas of Conservation were being designated on, and Agri-environment schemes designed for, their land. A 3 year, Teagasc-funded research project ensued which told the full story of farming and the Burren, highlighting the threats posed by recent changes in farming, but emphasising that farming and environmental lobbies had more in common than was recognised. This research provided the impetus for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Teagasc and the Burren Irish Farmers Association to come together in support of an EU-LIFE funded project aimed at developing a blueprint for sustainable farming in the region. This 5 year research project, again conducted at farm level in the Burren with the full involvement of local farmers, showed a way forward which could accommodate all stakeholder interests. With appropriate scientific input from a local project team, and based on lessons learned from the local research, a bespoke model to incentivise farmers to improve the environmental health of their farm was developed. Using this model, funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Burren Life Programme (2010-2015) was introduced, its subsequent success built on the solid foundations of strong local ownership and pride, effective working partnerships, and practical science. How does Burren Life operate? Burren Life uses a novel hybrid approach to farming for conservation which sees farmers paid for both work undertaken and, most importantly, for the delivery of defined environmental objectives. Within Burren Life, farmers are helped to prepare their own simple farm plan (most only 3 pages and very visual) each year by their trained advisor and the Burren Life team. The plan is tailored to suit the needs of the individual farm and outlines the two payment categories: 1. Payment for Actions The annual farm plan contains a list of actions (jobs) which are nominated by the farmer with the aim of improving the sites management and conservation condition. Each job is individually costed and co-funded by the farmer, and is carried out within the year by the farmer and/or a local contractor. Payment issues only when jobs are completed, and to a satisfactory standard. The farmer can opt-out of a planned action if he/she so chooses, ensuring maximum flexibility for the farmer. Most farms nominate a mixture of jobs to suit the needs of their land e.g. removing encroaching scrub from species-rich grassland, repairing internal walls or enhancing access. Protecting natural water sources and gathering, storing and supplying clean water are among some of the most popular jobs undertaken. Work completed over the first 6 years of the Burren Life Programme includes: 241ha of scrub (mainly hazel and blackthorn) removed across a wide area of the Burren 164km of (c.3m wide) stock paths opened through scrub to reconnect areas of grazing 112km of broken wall (gaps!) repaired and 720 new gates fitted 440 new watering points installed and scores of sensitive springs protected 55km of vehicle access tracks repaired or created, enabling improved long-term management 2. Payment for Results Every eligible field of species-rich Burren grassland and heath is assessed annually with a user-friendly habitat health checklist (one criterion used is the condition of the natural water sources in the field, for example). Each field receives a score between 1 and 10: all fields with a score greater than 3 receive payment but higher scores receive higher payments. This gives farmers the incentive to manage their fields in ways that will improve their scores and their payment as well. The results-based payment system allows farmers greater freedom to decide how to manage their land (with advice if needed) and also guarantees the taxpayer better value for money Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no delivery, no payment! It also generates data (see table below) which demonstrates the positive environmental impact of Burren Life. This graph shows that, between 2010 and 2015, the area of Burren grassland in very good condition (scoring >7) increased and the area in poorer condition (scoring ?7) decreased. Impact of Burren Life Over the course of the first 6 years (2010-2015), Burren Life has had major environmental and socio-economic impacts in the Burren. 5.9m has been invested directly in the region, with an average of 6,500 per year going to each farmer, with the added benefit that much of this money is recycled locally. Farmers themselves have invested an additional 1.6m in the programme through co-funding of farm works, amounting to a total spend of 7.5m. This funding has contributed to a number of spin-offs such as increased work for local contractors, more custom for local shops and manufacturers (e.g. Burren gates), and new farm-based tourism enterprises. Burren Life has delivered a range of proven environmental benefits on about 14,500ha of prime Burren habitat. It has cemented strong partnerships between farmers and management agencies, helped to create a very positive attitude towards conservation among farmers, and has generated a far greater appreciation of the role of farmers by the wider community. Through this work, Burren Life has made a very meaningful and lasting contribution to the future of Irelands most extraordinary landscape, the Burren. The success of the programme has contributed to the introduction of a new 70m measure for Locally-led Agri Environment Schemes in the Rural Development Programme 2015-2020, which includes an expansion of the programme across the entire Burren (30,000ha target area) with an estimated annual budget of 3-4m. www.burrenlife.com Related Posts Conservation Grazing in the Kerry Uplands This project seeks to develop evidence-based management recommendations for theâ€¦ Duhallow LIFE: a community led water and nature conservation programme Sustainable management of water and wildlife often requires the cooperationâ€¦ About author EPA Catchments Unit Administrator The EPA Catchments Unit is based in Dublin, and the team is involved with catchment science, chemistry, ecology, hydromorphology, modelling, Geographic Information Systems and planning.

This January, my project partner Riona Sheahan and I entered and displayed a project at the 52nd annual BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, 2016, held in the RDS in Dublin. Our project, entitled the â€œPlight of the Pearlsâ€�, investigated the factors that affect the distribution of the freshwater pearl mussel along the River Allow, a tributary of the River Blackwater in North County Cork. Of the factors that we investigated where mussels were present, we found that substrate size and siltation were the two factors that affected their distribution; depth of the water, distance of the mussels from the river bank, macro-habitat type, pH and temperature values and light intensity were all found not to have a significant impact. Total absence of pearl mussels in certain locations was associated with pollution discharges. Our project won the 3rd prize in the Biological and Ecological Sciences, Intermediate (Group), category, a major achievement for us and something we hope will contribute in a meaningful way to the saving of the pearl mussel. We first came across the freshwater pearl mussel in primary school. Dr Fran Igoe came to our schools to talk about our river and this was our first exposure to the species. Opting to work with Fran and the LIFE+ team for our project was an easy decision as not only was the mussel something of relevance to us as local people, a fact highlighted to us by the LIFE+ Projectâ€™s visit. We are extremely grateful to Fran Igoe, John Ballinger and Nuala Riordan for their assistance and advice during our project and our science teacher Mr Derry Oâ€™Donovan. At the exhibition itself, we met many members of the public who had either never heard of the pearl mussel or who only had scant information regarding the species. We were delighted to get the opportunity to talk to these people about the mussels and to explain to them how important it is that we conserve them in rivers where they remain. The awareness we raised through the undertaking of the project among our fellow students, our families, our friends and indeed members of the wider community was something we were delighted and we found that, while people might not have heard of the mussels before, they were delighted to learn about them and listened with interest. We intend to enter our project into the ECO-UNESCO Young Environmentalistâ€™s Awards at the end of February. This will bring further awareness to the â€œplight of the pearlsâ€� and we hope that all our work will make a difference in this area.

EPA research 155 Front Cover Identifying Pressures: Water is an essential commodity: human life and indeed all life on earth depends upon it. The question is how will we deal with it such that it sustains us now and in the future? Effective water management is critical to the future well-being of Irish society. We need an adequate supply of good quality, safe water Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for drinking, to protect biodiversity under the Habitats and Birds Directives, to obtain â€˜good qualityâ€™ status for all waterbodies as specified by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), and for industrial and agricultural use, especially in the context of Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) goals. Informing Policy: The Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) approach has been proposed (Harris, 2013; Daly, 2013) as being required to achieve effective water and catchment management, and implement the WFD. A key focus in ICM is developing a vision for the catchment, by involving local stakeholders. Article 14 of the WFD also specifies that consultation and involvement of the public be included as part of implementation, but EU WFD guidance states no blue-print exists for public participation, and the public participation process should be organised and adapted to national, regional and local circumstances. This study provides a practical guide to what works when engaging local communities around Ireland. Developing Solutions: Broadening the scope of possible management strategies by including different interests and stakeholder groups helps policy makers to develop flexible ways of managing the environment. This small scale study draws on StreamScapes 25 years of experience of delivering environmental education programmes around Ireland, focused on the aquatic environment and biodiversity. StreamScapes have helped local populations understand these issues at catchment scale. This report details the techniques they have developed for public engagement, and recommendations for the future.

The population is high compared with the rest of Ireland and there are several large urban centres, the largest being Waterford City, but 80% of the districtâ€™s population lives in small villages or one-off houses in rural areas. The rich soils of the south east are particularly suitable for agriculture and around half the land is given over to tillage and grassland. The districtâ€™s waters support fishing and boating activities and the coastlines of Wexford and Waterford are popular holiday resorts. Water is critical to the economy of the South Eastern RBD, generating and sustaining wealth through activities such as agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, power generation, industry, services, transport and tourism. However, water is a fragile resource that needs to be protected. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adopted in 2000. It requires governments to take a new approach to managing all their waters: rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, groundwaters, protected areas (including wetlands and other water-dependent ecosystems), estuaries (transitional) and coastal waters. Member states must ensure that their waters achieve at least good status, generally by 2027 at the latest, and that status doesnâ€™t deteriorate in any waters. To achieve good status and preserve the best waters, it is necessary to prepare and implement management plans for those waters. This plan is for the South Eastern RBD. It covers the period 2009â€“2015 and has been prepared in consultation with all stakeholders. It sets out the measures to be taken by all stakeholders and the tools to prioritise the application of available resources to those measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of the directive.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Stories News Contact Catchment News Home News Duhallow LIFE: a community led water and nature conservation programme Duhallow LIFE: a community led water and nature conservation programme April 14, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Stories Sustainable management of water and wildlife often requires the cooperation of local people living within a catchment. Something not always appreciated, however, is that these communities themselves can also positively contribute towards better water management, if encouraged to take a proactive role in the management of their local water resource. There are a number of Irish examples of projects (e.g. Loobagh, Slaney and Mulkear Rivers) where local people are working on initiatives with others to improve their catchments. This article highlights some of the achievements of a community led EU LIFE funded project, which is focused on the upper reaches of the Munster Blackwater River, in north Cork and east Kerry. The Blackwater River is one of Irelands largest rivers, extending some 160km from source to sea and draining an area in excess of 3,000km2. The river rises in the mountains of east Co. Kerry, traversing much of Co. Cork and flowing into west Co. Waterford, before entering the sea at Youghal Bay. The river is one of Irelands most important tourist angling rivers and large numbers of anglers travel from the UK and further afield, to stay in local fishing lodges and soak up the beautiful scenery, taking time out from their busy lives to relax and fish. The river is also important for a range of wildlife and together with its tributaries is designated as a Special Area of Conservation. This designation is due to the presence of species of EU conservation importance such as otters, kingfishers, lampreys and salmon. The river is also the largest Special Area of Conservation designated under the EU Habitats Directive for the protection of the rare Freshwater Pearl Mussel in Ireland. Like so many other Irish rivers, a wide range of pressures have led to a decline in the rivers habitat and water quality. These pressures include changes in the landscape and water quality; forestry, intensification of agriculture, peat cutting, land reclamation, drainage, drinking water and waste water treatment, runoff from increasing road traffic, windfarm development, urbanisation, and septic tanks from rural one-off houses all present challenges to the management of the river. All these pressures are associated with most catchments in modern Ireland and so any conservation or management lessons learnt on the River Blackwater should be relevant for other catchments. In 2009 the Kanturk Angling Club, who had been carrying out river habitat improvement works, approached IRD Duhallow Ltd, the rural development company active in the area, and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board (now Inland Fisheries Ireland), with a view to develop a large scale project to improve the river for fish. They recognised the need for a broader holistic approach that took in all aspects of the biodiversity along the river, rather than focusing just on fish, and identified the EU LIFE funding mechanism as a possible source of funding. On consultation with ecologists and people with experience in funding applications, a pragmatic approach was taken, following a simple logic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ protect the most sensitive species, the Freshwater Pearl Mussel, and other species such as the Atlantic Salmon and Brown Trout would also benefit. Freshwater Pearl Mussel require pristine habitat and water quality and therefore any efforts to protect them should improve the environment for other coexisting species, including fish. Actions to protect other species such as Kingfisher, Dipper, and Otter were also added to the projects remit to further increase biodiversity improvements and importantly help increase engagement of the wider public. A team was put together and the completed application submitted. The project was awarded funding in 2010. From the beginning, the project took a peoplecentred view by including the community at its core. In tandem with ten on-the-ground conservation actions, another 19 actions covered project planning and communication with the public and key stakeholders at a range of levels. The project endeavoured to form partnerships with the local landowners, interest groups and state agencies to maximise the projects reach and achieve buy-in by all stakeholders. Regular meetings, public information nights, field trips, door-to-door calls, newsletters, brochures and information signage all went part and parcel with the project, so that that the local community and the wider stakeholder interest groups were kept informed. Much of the project work on the ground was carried out by participants on the Rural Social Scheme and volunteers. Conservation actions were carried out on a large scale, sometimes spanning the farms of hundreds of landowners. For example, the invasive species Himalayan balsam was removed from almost 40km of river bank. This was conducted annually over a five year period to the point that the plant, once found in very high densities along rivers in the River Allow catchment, is now virtually absent. This was achieved through the mobilisation of large groups of people and through a sustained effort by all involved. It followed a carefully planned strategy, which took into account the stages of development of the plant at different locations along the catchment. It was found that plants in open sunlight areas reached maturity earlier than those in shaded areas and therefore had to be targeted first, before dealing with the slower growing plants in wooded areas. Plants in sunlit areas were found to seed earlier than those growing in more shaded areas. But all the while, the project worked from the source of infestation in a downstream direction, as the seeds themselves are waterborne and can infest a large area downstream of a mature plant. This work was all done by hand, without the use of chemicals and is, as far as we are aware, the largest manual Himalayan balsam control programme of its type in Europe. Full credit to all involved, and despite their initial reservations, the participants, suspended their understandable reservations to go picking flowers and made the control programme a success. A number of innovations to address specific environmental problems were developed by the project. For example, farming along the catchment occurs within the floodplain, incidentally where some of the best cuts of silage are taken. However at certain locations due to repeated inundation by water during flood events, it was not practical for farmers to fence the river banks to manage their livestock. These floods carry debris, ranging from rushes to fully grown oak trees, down the river which in turn lodge and build up on the fences eventually breaking them. The inability to fence such areas left the river banks vulnerable to trampling and over-grazing by farm animals. Therefore the LIFE project team developed a novel technique with the local farmers to address this problem; fencing that could be placed along river banks and survive the onslaught of debris carried by regular flooding episodes. This innovation allowed farmers to maintain their fence line, ensuring that the 38km of fencing placed by the LIFE project will last over time, and can withstand the increasing floods that we are experiencing. Similarly, innovations were developed to trap silt travelling along deeply cut farm drains before it reached the Special Area of Conservation and smother the spawning beds of fish and Freshwater Pearl Mussel habitat. Willow planting techniques using live willow stakes and poles were tested, and a best practice river bank restoration technique was developed to address the more severe river bank erosion situations by working with nature. Thousands of native trees were planted along the river banks to improve tree diversity along the riparian areas and encourage increased root mass to bind the soil in the river banks and improve river bank stability during flooding episodes. All trees were sourced locally, following best practice with regards to provenance, being donated by local people and a Coillte locally managed native woodland estate. A continuous survey of Freshwater Pearl Mussel was carried out from the upper most point of occurrence all the way downstream to Kanturk town, a river length of over 28km. This is the longest continuous survey of Freshwater Pearl Mussel in the UK or Ireland. All of the records (over 14,000 individual mussels) were mapped on GIS and the data not only helped direct conservation works, but also identified areas affected by acute pollution. The latter was followed up and will be the subject of a separate article in a future issue of this newsletter. Actions were also carried out to improve the conservation status of Otters, Kingfishers and Dippers by the placement of nest boxes, Otter Holts and brush bundles. These actions not only improved available habitat for these species, but also increased local awareness as local farmers were engaged in discussions with the project team during the construction phase. Education was a major element of the project. Thirty-six national schools and five secondary schools were visited by the project team and these kids were then bussed to their local stream or river, all tributaries of the Blackwater, for a demonstration by Inland Fisheries Ireland staff on how fish are sampled by electrofishing. Demonstrations were also given on aquatic macroinvertebrates monitoring for the determination of water quality. In addition, the children took part in a fun Nature Detective programme, where they recorded wildlife in their back gardens and farms with their parents, logging their observations into attractive survey booklets provided by the LIFE project. The data was then uploaded onto an online map hosted on the project website. To increase public engagement, the project was actively promoted on social media. Updates and photographs from our trap cameras were regularly posted and one post of an Otter marking its territory received over 7,000 views, with hits from countries as far away as Mexico. A major part of the project is that it now serves as a demonstration project to illustrate what can be done to improve nature conservation by working with farmers at the practical level on the ground. The demonstration farms provide real world examples of how nature and farming can co-exist in relative harmony rather than in perpetual conflict. The ethos of IRD Duhallow, which aims to improve not only the economy of the rural area but also the social, cultural, heritage and environment of local people, means that the project will continue to evolve and improve, and hopefully not only deliver a positive impact to the local environment but also provide insights for those with interest in sustainable management and nature conservation in Ireland. The IRD DuhallowLIFE project ran from 2010 to 2015 and is now into its afterLIFE phase. This is the phase in which the partners commit to continue the work originally supported by the LIFE fund of the European Union. This project is the first community led EU LIFE Nature project in Ireland and has now been augmented by a second project, RaptorLIFE which is not only targeting conservation actions at other tributaries on the Blackwater SAC but also towards the upland landscape to improve habitat for fish and birds of prey. A major element of this work is the removal of invasive species such as Japanese knotweed, removal of invasive conifers and other non-native species, and working with upland farmers. Large scale projects, such as LIFE projects in themselves can deliver significant results on the ground, but they are also catalysts towards better environmental management, as it is only through the constant partnership working and evolution of ideas and solutions that the challenges of nature and water conservation and sustainable living can be achieved. So I imagine the afterLIFE phase of these projects will continue for some time to come and will need to be nurtured into the longer term to deliver their true potential. www.duhallowlife.com Related Posts Catchment Case Study: The River Loobagh The River Loobagh is a tributary of the River Maigueâ€¦ Burren LIFE: Farming for Conservation The Burren region, located between Counties Clare and Galway, isâ€¦ About author EPA Catchments Unit Administrator The EPA Catchments Unit is based in Dublin, and the team is involved with catchment science, chemistry, ecology, hydromorphology, modelling, Geographic Information Systems and planning.

An inland mountain range, they form the boundary between counties Carlow and Wexford. The highest peaks are Mount Leinster (796m), Blackstairs (734m) and Slievebawn (527m). The climate is drier and sunnier than the west of Ireland and so the principal habitat is Dry Heath, though Blanket Bog and Wet Heath occur along with Acid Grassland as vegetation mosaics. The upper slopes of the mountain range are unenclosed and are farmed as commonage. Typically sheep, mostly Cheviot, are put up between April and June when the lambs are strong enough. They are brought down in autumn and the lambs sold on as store lambs. A small number of farmers graze the commonage year round. This usually depends on how much green lowland fields farmers have to support stock in the winter. A small number of farmers have cows (sucklers) and horses on the commonage but the vast majority use sheep. The Blackstairs mountain range covers circa 70km2, of which 50.52km2 corresponding to the unenclosed land is designated a Special Area of Conservation. Dry and Wet Heath exist outside the Special Area of Conservation on enclosed land along with good examples of Semi-natural Grassland and Woodland and the area qualifies as being of high nature value due to the presence and quality of its peatland habitats. The mountains also have value as a cultural landscape containing archaeological sites dating back 5000 years including cursus monuments, summit cairns, a portal tomb and a cluster of rock art sites from the Neolithic period. The field systems adjacent to the commonage contain some particularly large granite drystone walls, up to 2.5m high and 4m wide in places and artefacts linked to traditional farming practices. â€œYou have to be born into hill farming and have a genuine interest in itâ€� The economic viability of farming in The Blackstairs has been in decline for decades. It became clear that the future of hill farming and hill farming communities was precarious and a small group of people began to ask what could be done. In April 2014, funding for pilot locally led projects using a similar approach to the Burren LIFE project was included in the Irish Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. Contact was made with Dr Brendan Dunford (Burren LIFE) and Dr James Moran (IT Sligo) and on their advice the Blackstairs Farming Group was formed. A diverse group, there were many motivations for involvement, the predominant one being a desire for farming and farming communities in the Blackstairs to move from slow incessant decline to a more sustainable footing. There was also a shared connection to the land, to the Blackstairs and a desire for the skills and knowledge acquired by Blackstairs farmers over generations to be recognised, valued and sustained. â€œYou donâ€™t learn anything about hill farming in agricultural collegeâ€� Over the next year the Group attended events including the Burren Winterage School and the Who Cares for the Uplands conference organised by the Irish Uplands Forum. We learned about HNV Farming, Locally Led Agrienvironment Projects, Ecosystem Services and Public Goods and understood that our farmers produced goods which were valued by society but which could not be sold at the mart. That the farming system in the Blackstairs was responsible for the rich biodiversity and beauty of our landscape, providing high quality water supplies to surrounding towns and villages and storing carbon in upland peats. During this period we encountered The European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism. In March 2015 the European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism employed Colin Gallagher as the Forums High Nature Value Ireland Officer and offered technical support to our group to help us develop a locally led project. We were delighted but there was an obstacle. We needed to raise funds to assemble the baseline environmental data required. The composition of our committee was crucial in getting the funding we needed. It contained farmers, both lowland and hill farmers; a local architect who could place funding applications in policy context and who had knowledge of and confidence in community led design processes; two local councillors (elected representatives to local government) who were able to guide us through local administration and direct our funding request to decision makers, and a retired environmental science lecturer with experience and contacts in the field of environmental management. In June 2015 the Blackstairs Farming Group secured the funding required from sources including The Heritage Council and Carlow and Wexford Local Authorities. We then began to plan how to develop from being a small working group to a more representative group spanning two counties. Positive engagement betweenthe Blackstairs Farming Group committee, the project team and the local farming community was prioritised and included in the brief for the selection of the ecology team. The European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism also recognised that communication and engagement were important, and funded the role of a local coordinator to liaise with farmers, stakeholders and funding bodies and to manage the project locally. The project team were in place by mid-June 2015 and comprised Colin Gallagher (European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism High Nature Value Ireland Officer), Dr Mary Tubridy (Ecology Team) and Helena Fitzgerald (Local Coordinator and Blackstairs Farming Group Committee Member). The first project team meeting developed the methodology for the research phase of the project and included a plan for community engagement. This plan was then discussed and agreed by the Blackstairs Farming Group Committee. The research work involved gathering information on farming practices and changes to farming in the Blackstairs through face to face interview with and completion of a questionnaire by Blackstairs hill farmers. The habitat mapping involved field work to establish the extent and condition of habitats within the study area and included a series of farm walks around the mountain range attended by hill farmers and other stakeholders. The Blackstairs Farming Group committee contributed to the project planning phase, suggesting who the project team could make contact with and advising on practical issues like suitable access routes to the mountain. In addition the Blackstairs Farming Group agreed a communications plan which included placing regular project updates on social media (@BlackstairsFarm on Twitter and Blackstairs Farming Group on Facebook) and in local print media such as parish newsletters and newspapers. There was still concern that isolated farmers would not hear about the project, so the project coordinator and Blackstairs Farming Group Committee Members contacted many farmers by phone and text message to share information on the project and to encourage attendance at meetings and events. In some cases communication by land line was the only way of making contact with these farmers. In addition the project coordinator identified and contacted other stakeholders including Teagasc, Coillte and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. A particular challenge at this stage of the project was the absence of specific detail on what the project would mean for farmers. It was explained that the process was farmer-led and would reflect the issues farmers themselves identified as being important, however this approach was not a familiar one and for a period there were concerns that the project had an extremist environmental agenda to remove farmers from the mountain and re-wild. The work of Colin Gallagher was particularly skilful in making it clear that the project had a farming focus and in time concerns abated. A turning point came when hill farmers themselves explained to the concerned farmers that the wildlife and habitats on the hill were there because the hill was farmed, and that the project was working to identify how hill farming could be supported and optimised for the environment and for the farmer. â€œHow can hill farming become more attractive for the young farmer?â€� By September 2015 the information gathering phase of the project was complete and it was decided to hold an information meeting to present the research findings to Blackstairs farmers. At the meeting held in Rathanna on the 9th October and attended by circa 70 hill farmers and other stakeholders, it was unanimously agreed to proceed to the next stage of development of the locally led project. Colin Gallagher presented his analysis of data from the Irish Central Statistics Office which indicated a 50% drop since 1991 in the number of farms in the Blackstairs where the main holder was under 44, with a 50% reduction in sheep numbers over the same period. At the meeting representative farmers from around the mountain joined the Blackstairs Farming Group committee to participate in a series of workshops to further develop the project. â€œI would love to be farming full time or even to make it profitable enough to hand on to the next generationâ€� The project report A Case For a Locally Led Agri Environment Scheme For The Blackstairs, Preliminary Proposal will be ready in early 2016. This report will shape our submission to Irelands Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine for Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 funding under the locally led measure. The engagement with Blackstairs farmers over the last 9 months, involving over 800 hours of voluntary input by Blackstairs hill farmers has indicated that in addition to the locally led project there is interest in developing other business areas to support the hill farming enterprise, including potentially forming a lamb producer group, developing sustainable tourism products and farm based businesses associated with the management of the mountain. It has also become clear that Blackstairs farmers who have come to project meetings to listen, learn and contribute are keen to innovate and are outward looking; characteristics hill farmers are not usually credited with. The legacy of our project with the European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism is a sense of momentum which we would like to build on as we work towards more sustainable and resilient farming communities in the Blackstairs. Given the rate of decline and the age profile of our farmers, the question is; are we too late?

The home range and resource selection of Dexters (a native breed) in the 462 hectare Mount Brandon Nature Reserve in County Kerry is being investigated. It is a collaborative project between the Institute of Technology, Tralee, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and an organic farmer in west Kerry. In Ireland the uplands (land over 150 m) form our greatest expanses of semi-natural habitats. Almost 29% of the country is considered upland and over 40% of the Natura2000 Network occurs in these areas. Uplands are important areas for conservation, supporting many rare and threatened plant and animal species, and containing up to 14 habitat types listed under Annex I of the Habitats Directive (Perrin et al., 2014). Annex I habitats are of particular community importance and member states are obliged to maintain priority habitats in favourable conservation status. The latter half of the twentieth century brought about widespread degradation of Irelandâ€™s upland habitats, due in part to inappropriate gazing regimes (Heritage Council, 1999). Reforms have tried to redress imbalances in the uplands, much of which are deemed to be High Nature Value farmland, using a wide range of measures. However, the conservation status of the majority of designated upland habitats in Ireland is currently assessed to be in poor or bad condition (National Parks and Wildlife Service, 2013). Grazing trials were initiated in 2011 with the Dexters, a small and hardy Irish breed. The cattle, based in the lowlands for much of the year, are brought to the mountain in mid-July and have unlimited access to the 462 hectare site and its range of habitats until October. The research focuses on the four main habitat types available to the cattle; dry heath (145 ha), wet heath (62 ha), blanket bog (71 ha) and wet grassland (14 ha). The higher slopes of the reserve are dominated by montane heath and support an interesting arctic-alpine flora, but these heights (>500 m) are not utilised by the cattle and are not under examination. Control plots were established in each of the main habitats in 2011, prior to the cattle being introduced to the site. Home range and habitat selection studies were conducted between 2013 and 2015, which involved tracking selected animals with GPS collars. These data were used to generate home range estimates and conduct habitat selection analysis. Vegetation and ground beetle (Carabid) sampling was completed each year in order to examine how the grazing impacted habitats and species. The 30 cattle used in this study have set up a home range of approximately 100 ha each season, the size, shape and structure of which has been stable both within and between years. This is probably dependent on the distribution of habitat patches in the reserve, as well as factors such as water availability and ease of access between habitat patches. Habitat selection was significant, with cattle showing most preference for wet grassland patches, and least for blanket bog. Knowledge of the behaviour and grazing preferences of cattle in unenclosed landscapes has potential value for land owners and farmers in the development of grazing prescriptions and management plans for sensitive upland ecosystems. The analysis of vegetation and invertebrate data is ongoing and focusses on relating the intensity of use by the cattle to various elements of biodiversity e.g. species richness and diversity, the response of Molinia caerulea â€˜Purple Moor Grassâ€™ and importantly, the conservation status of the Annex I habitats (sensu Habitats Directive). The project is due for completion in May 2016.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Stories News Contact Catchment News Home News Eden Demonstration Test Catchment, UK Eden Demonstration Test Catchment, UK April 14, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , Stories Introduction A two-day visit to England was made by Marie Archbold, Donal Daly, Jenny Deakin, Paddy Morris (all EPA) and Deirdre Fay (DAFM) on 29th â€“ 30th April 2015. The purpose was to learn from the work of the Eden River Trust in Cumbria and the Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) research, and the research being undertaken by the Allerton Project, run by the Game & Wildlife Conservancy in the Eye Brook catchment, Loddington, Leicestershire. Objective The main objective was to derive comparisons between catchment research and characterisation being carried out in the UK and that being carried out in Ireland by Teagasc in the Agricultural Catchments Programme and by the EPA in their Catchment Science and Management Unit. The purpose of this article is to reflect on the knowledge gained during the trip in the context of the DAFM funded Agricultural Catchments Programme, with a particular focus on the River Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (Eden DTC). The Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) The River Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (Eden DTC) is a DEFRA funded research project. The aim of the project is to assess if it is possible to cost effectively mitigate diffuse pollution from agriculture whilst maintaining agricultural productivity. The project is working in three focus catchments within the River Eden catchment, selected to represent a range of land uses, physical characteristics and weather. The focus areas are in the Dacre, Morland and Pow catchments. Each catchment has an area of approximately 10 km2. The projects involve monitoring the stream water quality and biology and looking at how the catchment responds to storm events. Working closely with farmers in the catchment to test a range of mitigation measures in real catchment situations is an important element of the project. The project aims are three fold: To produce evidence to test the hypothesis that it is possible to cost effectively reduce the impact of agricultural diffuse pollution to water on ecological function, while maintaining food security, through the implementation of multiple on farm measures. To develop a research platform to host collaborative research. To develop a common vision for catchment management centred around local knowledge and understanding. Eden Stakeholder Engagement Framework Each focus catchment was selected to represent the full range of natural and anthropogenic variation across the Eden catchment as summarised below: Morland Catchment Limestone/sandstone/mudstone Sandy clay loam/clay loam Artificial drainage 87% grassland, 71% improved Dairy/beef/sheep 1150 mm rainfall Pow Catchment Limestone/sandstone/mudstone Sandy clay loam/clay loam Artificial drainage 46% improved grassland, 37% arable Intensive dairy/beef/sheep/pigs/poultry 810 mm rainfall Dacre catchment Dacre Catchment Upland Volcanic andesite, glacial till Sandy clay loam/clay loam 80% grassland, 16% woodland Extensive sheep grazing 1570 mm rainfall Catchment pressures include intensive farming, erosion of river banks by livestock, flash flooding from hills and lowland drainage, abstraction, pollution and silting, and climate change and increasing frequency of floods and droughts. A variety of changes in farm and land management are being trialled in the Eden DTC to reduce the impacts of diffuse pollution on surface water and groundwater. These are being delivered through advice and support on soil and nutrient management, tailored to the specific geography and types of farm practice. Researchers and advisors are working with farmers to identify flow pathways, specific problems and â€˜hotspotsâ€™ such as vulnerable fields and hard standings. Catchment monitoring includes the collection and telemetry of water quality data such as phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonium, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity, water temperature, chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen, as well as hydro-meteorological data such as rainfall, river stage/flow and other meteorological parameters. In addition non-telemetered data is collected such as monthly spot samples, storm samples, biological samples, borehole levels and chemical analyses of borehole samples, soil samples, faecal indicator organism samples, farm business and farmer attitude surveys. Each focus catchment contains 2 sub-catchments, a control catchment and a mitigation catchment, each with an area of approximately 2 km2. For each mitigation sub-catchment a conceptual approach is adopted based on source, mobilisation, delivery and receptor. Eden DTC Water Framework Directive Classification Interventions being tested include: Development of nutrient management plans targeting dirty water, slurry, manure and fertiliser spreading. Working with land managers to deliver large scale investment in farm infrastructure such as slurry and silage storage and manure management processes. Installing drains, ponds, lagoons and stone barriers where required. Improvement of livestock and machinery tracks to prevent erosion and rapid transfer of pollutants to watercourses. Establishing riparian buffer strips and stream-bank fencing to exclude livestock. Fencing may be coupled with some carefully targeted additional options such as constructed wetlands, and settling ponds for sediment and associated nutrient removal. Reduced cultivation methods such as strip tillage and the use of cover crops to reduce bare soil after harvest and to take up residual nitrogen. Biobeds to reduce pesticide pollution from sprayers. The sprayers are washed down on a hard standing and the polluted water broken down in a bed of straw, soil and peat. Initial research findings are showing positive effects in the mitigation sub-catchments, with a 28%, 39%, 27%, and 31% decrease in total phosphorus, total reactive phosphate, nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen respectively, as well as a 35% increase in suspended solids. Concluding remarks A particular success of the Eden DTC of working is the close working relationship with farmers to test a range of mitigation measures in real catchment situations. This approach is an invaluable element of the project, and fosters a meaningful exchange of knowledge between researchers, advisors, farmers and policy makers. It is recommended that a similar research based mitigation approach is considered alongside the existing research based monitoring programme, in any subsequent funding of the Agricultural Catchments Programme to ensure a simultaneous focus on maximising the uptake of best management practices by farmers, as well as the development of national sustainable intensification policies.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Stories News Contact Catchment News Home News Catchment Case Study: The River Loobagh Catchment Case Study: The River Loobagh April 14, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , Stories The River Loobagh is a tributary of the River Maigue in County Limerick and has a catchment of approximately 129km2. The Loobagh rises in the Ballyhoura Mountains and flows through the Towns of Kilfinane and Kilmallock before joining the River Maigue south of Bruree. The Loobagh and its tributaries are important salmon spawning waters and also support healthy populations of trout. Water quality in the Loobagh is generally good, particularly since the wastewater treatment plants serving Kilfinane and Kilmallock were upgraded in recent years. However, in August 2014, 70,000 gallons of slurry leaked from a steel slurry tower in to the Loobagh just up-stream of Kilmallock and killed hundreds of fish over several kilometres. While this event was deeply upsetting for the local community, particularly the anglers, a silver lining was that it focused attention on the river and highlighted its potential as a fishery. As a result, the decision was taken to pilot a number of initiatives in this area with a view to developing a model of catchment management which would mobilise the local communities to become stewards of their aquatic resources and allow the river to achieve its potential as a high status water body and thriving fishery. Aims of this pilot To raise awareness of the multiple benefits that healthy waterways offer to all sectors of society and of the ways in which we can all impact water quality as we go about our daily lives; embed the idea that economic, social and environmental sustainability are inextricably linked, and empower communities to manage their rivers in a way that allows them to achieve the benefits they need while at the same time protecting water quality and biodiversity. Educational and Awareness Programme An education and awareness programme called â€œStreamscapes Loobaghâ€�, developed by Coomhola Salmon Trust, was delivered to all of the primary and secondary schools in the catchment and evening sessions were held in three locations for the wider community. The programme was received with huge enthusiasm and the feedback from all those who attended was extremely positive. This pilot was funded by LCCC, however, it is hoped to encourage community groups to organise similar events in the future and to apply for funding under programmes such as Local Agenda 21. Stakeholder Group A stakeholder group has been established with representatives from community groups, farming organisations, the local development company, Coillte, Inland Fisheries Ireland, local councillors and landowners. A study trip was undertaken to the Ballinderry catchment in Northern Ireland to look at the work of The Rivers Trust there. The group felt that the Trustâ€™s model of community involvement in river planning and the co-operative approach to solving water quality issues would be very success in the Loobagh area, but acknowledged that having full time dedicated staff was probably something that would not be possible in the immediate future. In the meantime however, it is hoped to establish a voluntary â€œimplementation groupâ€� which would be a sub-committee of the stakeholder group and which would be positioned to apply to for funding for relevant projects through programmes such as Rural Development Programme, Lottery Funding, Failte Ireland, Local Agenda 21 etc. There are several other initiatives underway in the catchment including: In-stream Works The Local Anglers, with the assistance of Inland Fisheries Ireland, identified in-stream works which would improve the habitat for Salmon and Trout and restore fish numbers after the fish kill. They approached the councillors in the Municipal District of Killmallock-Cappamore who enthusiastically supported the proposals and allocated funds from the General Muncipal Allocation to fund phase 1 of the works. These works included the construction of rubble mats, weirs, gravel beds, thalwegs and other structures to improve the conditions for fish to breed and thrive. The funding was used to purchase stone and gravel and the works were carried out by the OPW under their River Improvements Programme. Riverfly Monitoring Programme The Riverfly monitoring programme is a â€œcitizen scienceâ€� project which has been up and running in the UK for a number of years. It will be trialled in the Loobagh over the coming months. This project will provide training to interested community members, anglers and landowners in a simplified method of biological monitoring, which will allow people to monitor and assess their local rivers and streams. The first training session is scheduled for October this year and has been offered to members of the stakeholder group. If feedback from this group is positive, the programme will be offered to the wider community. Control of Invasive Species One of the issues highlighted by the group at an early stage was the problem of Giant Hogweed along the banks of the Loobagh. It was agreed that a high priority for the group should be to implement a programme to control this weed. Ballyhoura Development Ltd, the local development country has submitted an application for funding under Local Agenda 21, on behalf of the group, to provide training to participants in a local Rural Social Scheme in pesticide use and control of invasive species. If the application is successful, the training will be delivered in early 2016 and the control programme will commence at the start of the growing season. It is envisaged that eradication from the catchment will take between five and ten years. Changing attitudes â€“ engagement and empowerment While the Loobagh project is in its early stages, already there is a perceptible shift in attitude: members of the stakeholder group and community groups in the area are already embracing the challenge and the traditional â€œwhy donâ€™t they do something about the problemâ€� has to become â€œletâ€™s see what we can do about itâ€�! This is the essence of meaningful community engagement and empowerment.

As local charities they are often described as having â€œwet feetâ€� because they have the reputation of being â€œdoersâ€�, concentrating their effort on practical catchment, river and fishery improvement works on the ground. In the history of almost every trust there has been a key trigger leading to their formation, for example through a concern over the general decline in species and water quality in a river or a pollution incident which resulted in the loss of fish and other wildlife. Such events focus minds and often the decision by local rivers users, landowners and other interested parties, to form a new trust or similar body is often seen as a most appropriate and effective way forward in order to begin the restoration of the river. There are already a number of rivers trusts established or are forming across Ireland. The Slaney Rivers Trust, Nore Suir Rivers Trust and Blackwater Rivers Trust are all well-established rivers trusts making a difference to the health of the rivers in their catchments. The Waterville Lakes and Rivers Trust in County Kerry, Maigue Rivers Trust in County Limerick and Inishowen Rivers Trust in County Donegal are all in the process of forming. These trusts join the 7 established rivers trusts in Northern Ireland, 44 in England and Wales and 25 rivers and fisheries trust in Scotland â€“ a network with a vast wealth of knowledge and expertise in river conservation and management and who are always happy to help each other. The Department of Environment, Communities and Local Government (DECLG) and the newly formed Local Authority Water and Communities Office (LAWCO) are keen to see the development of rivers trusts across Ireland. The Department has provided funding to The Rivers Trust (the umbrella body for rivers trusts www.theriverstrust.org ) to support the role of the All-Ireland Development Officer â€“ Mark Horton, who is based at, and manages, Ballinderry Rivers Trust in County Tyrone. Mark is on hand to offer advice and support to groups who are interested in forming a rivers trust in their area. Talks can be provided to groups on what rivers trusts are, the work they are involved in and how they form, as well as support and guidance in then setting up a rivers trust as a charity. If you would like to find out more about rivers trusts contact Mark Horton (All-Ireland Development Officer) on 00 44 28 867 61515 or e-mail mark@theriverstrust.org , or contact the Waters and Communities Office on info@lawco.ie Related Posts Catchment Case Study: The River Loobagh The River Loobagh is a tributary of the River Maigueâ€¦ ""Plight of the Pearls""- Young Scientists look at Pearl Mussels in the River Allow By Darragh O'Keeffe, Transition Year Student, Colaiste Treasa, Kanturk, Cork.â€¦ About author EPA Catchments Unit Administrator The EPA Catchments Unit is based in Dublin, and the team is involved with catchment science, chemistry, ecology, hydromorphology, modelling, Geographic Information Systems and planning.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Stories News Contact Catchment News Home News Locally Led Agri-environment Schemes: Innovation, partnership, locally adapted and results orientated solutions Locally Led Agri-environment Schemes: Innovation, partnership, locally adapted and results orientated solutions May 16, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , Get Invloved , News Author: James Moran, Sligo IT Irelandâ€™s Locally Led Agri-environment Scheme (LLAES) proposals in our current Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 have significant potential to bring innovative solutions to bear to ensure sustainable land management. It is specifically targeted at meeting the requirements of EU Birds, Habitats and Water Framework Directives and has a total budget over the programme period of â‚¬70 million. The LLAES measure is included in the RDP to complement the national level Green Low-Carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) which is a traditional action based approach which pays farmers to undertake particular actions which are linked to cross-cutting objectives of climate change, water quality and biodiversity. The LLAES aims to address particular environmental and biodiversity challenges not addressed at national level by GLAS. It is envisaged that this will include both schemes addressing centrally identified priorities, and also an open competitive call. All priorities will be linked to implementation of the Birds, Habitats and Water Framework Directives. The centrally identified priorities include the continuation of the successful BurrenLIFE programme, priority pearl mussel catchments, and hen harrier areas. LLAES should encourage locally driven solutions and will require submission of proposals by local groups accompanied by detailed estimates of costs. The only current theme identified for the competitive call in the RDP is the conservation/restoration of upland peatlands. At the moment it looks like there will be LLAES developed for the Burren; Freshwater Pearl Mussel Catchments; Hen Harrier Area and Upland Peatlands. The detail of how the LLAES measure will operate is not yet finalised apart from the Burren scheme. Looking at the Burren together with the overview of the LLAES measures available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine gives us some pointers on how other locally led schemes might operate. BurrenLIFE takes a farmer led approach where the farmer nominates and co-funds conservation actions on their farm, giving them the freedom to farm. This is similar to the traditional action based approach of GLAS but what makes the Burren different it that it combines these actions with a results based payment. To ensure that the desired results are achieved payments are made to farmers based on the environmental condition of their farm. Essentially each field gets a quality score and farmers who deliver the best environmental outcomes receive the highest payments. This innovative programme is held up as an example across the EU of how results based agri-environment schemes can work . Key to its development and success has been the local partnership approach where farmers, NGOs, state agencies and government departments came together to find locally tailored and practical management solutions. This partnership is solidified in the implementation of the scheme where the farmers tailor the scheme to their farms and are supported by a dedicated project team, steering group and farm advisors. A partnership approach will be key to the success of other LLAES over the next 5 years. The partnership approach works and is needed to secure stakeholder involvement and bring together the range of expertise to develop and implement the scheme. Through the development of the partnerships dedicated community champions will emerge that will take the initiative and drive innovation. There are currently a number of groups around the country setting up local partnerships and the prospect of a LLAES is a welcome catalyst for the development of such partnerships. The development of these local partnerships can be an opportunity for farmers and the wider community to come together. Supported by government departments and agencies these groups have the potential to achieve the sustainable management of natural resources at local level. Locally-led Schemes â€“ A suggested 10 step plan Below is a suggested 10 step plan to develop a LLAES proposal that may be useful to local groups interested in LLAES. As can be seen local partnerships will need considerable support to develop meaningful proposals. Emerging groups should be supported as LLAES have significant potential to develop results orientated and innovative solutions. Steps Considerations 1. What is the environmental/biodiversity goal for your area? Current priorities = Hen Harrier, Pearl Mussel Catchments and Upland Peatlands. Set goals related to yours selected priority 2. What is the environmental baseline? What is the current state of the target for your area? Use existing information where possible. 3. What is already paid for in GLAS? LLAES must be additional to GLAS, double payment is not allowed. 4. Define specific target and location What is your specific target in terms of land type and location? Should be informed by step 2. 5. Start developing proposals At this stage the local group should assess if it has the expertise and resources to develop programme. Identify if there is local support available? 6. Build understanding of the relationship between farm management and your environmental target What are the qualities of a field/farm that provide the optimum conditions to achieve your environmental goal. Can a set of costed actions be developed that are linked to the achievement of optimum condition? 7. Development of indicators of success Can a simple set of variables be selected that can be used to measure the delivery of the required result for the environment? Used as a basis for payment for result. 8. Are landscape-scale measures required? Is there a need for groups of farmers to work together to deliver the required results? If desired this will add additional complexity that needs to be taken into account in scheme design. 9. Identification of institutional capacity to deliver Need to ensure sufficient resources (financial and staff) will be available for ongoing implementation, monitoring and evaluation if proposal is successful. Ensure running costs are built into proposal. 10. Draft proposal developed and ready for call. Includes: Scheme outline for area covering geographical extent; Target species/habitats; Scheme requirements; Detailed costings including resource requirements for ongoing implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

Dundalk Bay Events: What does your river mean to you? March 09, 2017 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , Get Invloved , News , Stories , Water and Communities Meetings are being held with communities along the rivers of the Dundalk Bay Catchment. These free events will allow you to share stories, knowledge and ideas, and learn about how you can create a plan for the future of the rivers of Dundalk Bay. This is your opportunity to meet individuals and groups who have an interest in the waters, wildlife and heritage on your doorstep. From the uplands of Cooley, the Big and Flurry Rivers flow to Dundalk Bay; the Cullywater and Castletown flow from South Armagh through Dundalk town; the Fane valley skirts the border making its way through Castleblayney and Inniskeen to the coast at Blackrock. The Glyde rises in the Kingscourt area and meets the Proules from Carrickmacross before advancing to Tallanstown to join the Dee near Annagasson. Nobber streams flow into the Dee then through Ardee to the sea at Annagasson; the White River flows through Dunleer before joining the Dee. Dundalk Bay is a Special Area of Conservation for Bird species and shellfish and as such is very sensitive to changes in water quality. These rivers were the roadways of the Ancient East leaving us with an enviable heritage legacy from the Viking forts and the only castle in Ireland built by a woman, Castle Roche, to the land of legends and Irish chieftans. Today, our waterways are still a most precious resource. Lough Muckno is described as the jewel in the crown of Irish Coarse Angling; the Fane and Castletown are noted for salmon and sea trout. Our waterways provide a home to many of our most iconic bird and wildlife species. Increasingly, communities and tourists are using waterways as blueways for sport and recreation. The water is also an important resource for economic development throughout the catchment with the Fane, Glyde and Dee providing drinking water for most of the population. Dundalk bay is economically important for fishing and as a recreational amenity. We are inviting everyone: individuals, businesses, farmers, interest groups, anglers, clubs and communities to participate in our events: 28 th February 8:00 pm Carlingford Heritage Centre, Carlingford 13 th March 8:00 pm Carrickmacross Workhouse 15 th March 8:30 pm Kingscourt Community Centre 21 st March 8:00 pm Hope Castle Lodge Castleblayney 23 rd March 8:00 pm Market House Dunleer 28 th March 8:00 pm Spirit Store, Dundalk 30 th March 8:00 pm Crossmaglen Community Centre These free events aim to gather peopleâ€™s experiences, memories and ideas in order to create a community vision for the future of local waterways. This new approach called the RIPPLE method will include contributions from local speakers and interactive activities to promote sharing and learning and is guaranteed to be fun. Hosted by the newly established Local Authorities Waters and Communities Office (LAWCO) in order to develop a â€˜visionâ€™ for Dundalk Bay rivers. The Waters and Communities office was set up in 2016 to raise public awareness of our water resources and encourage local communities, public bodies and all stakeholders to work together in the management of our natural waters. Your local Community Water Officer is Gretta McCarron who is looking forward to meeting you at an event near you.

High Nature Value farmland comprises those areas of Europe where agriculture is a major (usually the dominant) land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high level of species and habitat diversity, or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both. A range of European Union (EU) policies are targeted at High Nature Value farmland and all EU Member States are required to identify, monitor and support the ecological and economic viability of High Nature Value farmlands. Despite their important role in the delivery of ecosystem services, many of these areas are under threat from abandonment, intensification and land use change. A broad range of landscape types in Ireland are represented in High Nature Value farmland including extensively farmed uplands, areas of calcareous grassland and limestone pavement, machair/coastal grasslands, the drumlin belt from Clew Bay to Cavan with large areas of wet grasslands, the islands, river floodplains and the Wexford slobs. A national map of High Nature Value farmland likelihood for Ireland at electoral division (ED) scale highlights the varied nature of the agricultural land base. The spatial coincidence of High Nature Value farmland and rivers of good ecological status, and areas with high and very high High Nature Value farmland likelihood, were compared with the distribution of river water bodies of good ecological status (2010â€“2012). Of the assessed river lengths, 63% of the river water bodies at good status and 79% of the river water bodies at high status occurred in areas with high High Nature Value farmland potential. Download the report: http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/research/water/research209.html About the report: EPA-funded research generates a scientific knowledge base to support environmental protection. Projects are carefully targeted to deliver on three key areas: Identifying pressures; Informing policy, Developing Solutions. Identifying Pressures The growing demand for a wide range of public goods and services from land in the context of growing populations and a finite resource base is placing significant pressures on farmers and farmland in Ireland and worldwide. Farmers in Ireland with intermediate quality farmland are similarly confronted by multiple, often conflicting demands, because it can support extensive livestock farming; often has high potential for forestry; contains landscapes valued for their biodiversity, recreation and cultural values; and has potential for renewable energy generation and water provision. Policy objectives for different land use types and the services required from the range of agricultural land use intensities in Ireland need to be much clearer. Scotlandâ€™s recent development of a land use strategy can provide many lessons for Ireland and highlights the challenges in trying to maximise benefits while minimising the trade-offs in the delivery of multiple services (Slee et al. 2014). The complex policy demands coupled with the heterogeneity of the land base further highlights the need for translation of clear national policy into local initiatives. Informing Policy High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) occurs predominantly (though not exclusively) in the west of the country and in upland areas in the rest of the country and has high spatial coincidence with high status water and the head water streams of larger downstream rivers. The management of High Nature Value farmland for biodiversity has the potential to have co-benefits for water quality and quantity (the regulation of flooding and maintaining base flow). Improved co-ordination and spatial targeting of initiatives to High Nature Value farmland could play a major role in meeting both the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and the Birds and Habitats Directives, while delivering other ecosystem services. Developing Solutions Different approaches are required to meet Water Framework Directive targets on High Nature Value farmland compared to intensive farmland. In High Nature Value farmland areas there needs to be a focus on promotion of farming activities that meet water and biodiversity objectives rather than focus on mitigation actions that may be required for activities associated with intensive agricultural practices. A framework needs to be developed which maps out a pathway for the development of integrated approaches for the management of our land, water and living resources to ensure sustainable use. There is a real need to expand the range of locally-led integrated catchment/ landscape management initiatives which aim to simultaneously provide multiple ecosystem services. These initiatives must take a participatory approach which will encourage an innovative network of stakeholders working in partnership to develop locally-adapted and results-orientated solutions. Success factors for local initiatives such as the Burren Programme highlight the need to secure a broad range of stakeholder involvement and the key role of dedicated community â€œchampionsâ€� to take the initiative and drive innovation. A flexible and adaptive management approach which is well researched and knowledge based is needed. This recognises the value of sound science and traditional knowledge. Local initiatives need to be supported by state agencies and government departments with an integrated knowledge transfer/advisory service.

Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Stories News Contact Welcome to Catchments.ie - Water from source to sea. Water is a precious resource and is essential for all life on earth. Looking after our rivers, lakes and coastal waters so they can meet our current and future needs, and also continue to support the ecosystems that depend on them, is vital for Irelandâ€™s future. Doing this at community level is the best way to get people actively involved.

Sharing science and stories about Integrated Catchment Management in Ireland. Integrated Catchment Management is a community-led approach that aims to involve people and groups from across society. 46 Catchments 583 Subcatchments 4829 Waterbodies View Data and Dashboards What is a catchment, and why should you care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other waterbody. We all want to have good quality schools and hospitals in our community, as this can help with enhancing education and health, and overall quality of life. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can help make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like agriculture, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. Find out more Using data to help understand our catchments Managing our catchments effectively requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information. This includes: how people use the land and waterbodies, and what livelihoods are supported; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water flows both above and below ground from where it falls as rain to the sea; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. You can see lots of this information on the Maps and Data pages, which will be added to over time. These pages show information about our 46 catchments, 583 subcatchments and 4829 waterbodies. Many waterbodies have charts available for trends in key biological and chemical indicators, which can help us understand how healthy they are, and the possible causes of any changes. Find out more How to get involved with you local catchment and make a difference today While understanding what is affecting our catchments and waterbodies can help us manage them, experience from projects in Ireland and around the world has shown that local community involvement is one of the keys to long-term success. There are many ways for individuals or local communities to get involved â€“ this can be anything from organising a Spring Clean of a riverbank once a year, getting your local Tidy Towns committee to look at how your river or lake can help your town become a nicer place to live, or even establishing a Rivers Trust or locally led agri-environment scheme to help draw down funding and establish a long term plan for your area. You can sign up for our quarterly Catchments Newsletter using the form at the top of this page, and if you let us know what county you are in, we can contact you with relevant information about anything new that starts in your county. Find out more Survey on septic tanks and your local catchment Weâ€™re currently running a survey on Septic Tanks, and how you relate to your local catchment. Weâ€™d like to use the results of this survey to communicate with local communities better, specifically on the possible health and environmental risk from malfunctioning septic tank systems. All data is anonymous, we do not record your IP address or any other identifying data. You can fill out the survey and find out more at the link below.

Quite simply, everyone in Ireland has a role to play. This can be from something as simple as making sure you donâ€™t pollute your local stream, or a local community working together to establish a Rivers Trust to enhance the rivers and lakes in their area, to a Government Department or Agency helping a Minister implement a new policy to help protect and enhance all our waterbodies. This website has been developed and is maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency, and is a collaboration between the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office. Local Authority Waters and Communities Office The Waters and Communities Office has been established to carry out public consultation and engagement, and to coordinate the activities of all 31 local authorities in areas connected with the Water Framework Directive. Environmental Protection Agency The EPA is responsible for coordinating the monitoring, assessment and reporting on the status of our 4829 waterbodies, looking at trends and changes and determining which waterbodies are at risk and what could be causing this, and drafting environmental objectives and measures for each. Department of Environment, Community and Local Government The Department is responsible for making sure that the right policies, regulations and resources are in place to implement the Water Framework Directive, and developing a River Basin Management Plan and Programme of Measures that will be implemented after public consultation, and sign off by the Minister.
