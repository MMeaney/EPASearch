Water is a precious resource and is essential for all life on earth. Looking after our rivers, lakes and coastal waters so they can meet our current and future needs, and also continue to support the ecosystems that depend on them, is vital for Irelandâ€™s future. Doing this at community level is the best way to get people actively involved.

Sharing science and stories about Integrated Catchment Management in Ireland. Integrated Catchment Management is a community-led approach that aims to involve people and groups from across society. 46 Catchments 583 Subcatchments 4829 Waterbodies View Data and Dashboards What is a catchment, and why should you care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other waterbody. We all want to have good quality schools and hospitals in our community, as this can help with enhancing education and health, and overall quality of life. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can help make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like agriculture, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. Find out more Using data to help understand our catchments Managing our catchments effectively requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information. This includes: how people use the land and waterbodies, and what livelihoods are supported; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water flows both above and below ground from where it falls as rain to the sea; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. You can see lots of this information on the Maps and Data pages, which will be added to over time. These pages show information about our 46 catchments, 583 subcatchments and 4829 waterbodies. Many waterbodies have charts available for trends in key biological and chemical indicators, which can help us understand how healthy they are, and the possible causes of any changes. Find out more How to get involved with your local catchment and make a difference today While understanding what is affecting our catchments and waterbodies can help us manage them, experience from projects in Ireland and around the world has shown that local community involvement is one of the keys to long-term success. There are many ways for individuals or local communities to get involved â€“ this can be anything from organising a Spring Clean of a riverbank once a year, getting your local Tidy Towns committee to look at how your river or lake can help your town become a nicer place to live, or even establishing a Rivers Trust or locally led agri-environment scheme to help draw down funding and establish a long term plan for your area. You can sign up for our quarterly Catchments Newsletter using the form at the top of this page, and if you let us know what county you are in, we can contact you with relevant information about anything new that starts in your county.

How do we manage our catchments? Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Guide to the Water Framework Directive Home Guide to the Water Framework Directive The Water Framework Directive was agreed by all individual EU member states in 2000, and its first cycle ran from 2009-2015. The Directive runs in 6 year cycles, so the 2nd Cycle runs from 2016-2021. Having one Framework for water quality for all of the 4,933 waterbodies in Ireland, and all the others across Europe, allows us to compare our results, and see what works to help us make sure all our surface and ground water achieves at least Good Status, and no deterioration occurs. Rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional water can all have 5 statuses: High Good Moderate Poor Bad Groundwater has just 2 statuses â€“ Good and Poor. Status is assessed under the following headings: Biological Quality Fish Benthic Invertebrates (These are small animals that live at the bottom of a waterbody or in sediment, and have no backbone) Aquatic Plants Hydromorphological Quality â€“ this is how a river flows, and can be affected by river bank structure, river continuity, or the substrate of the river bed. Physical-chemical quality such as temperature, oxygenation and nutrient conditions Chemical quality for specific pollutants Assessing Status â€“ one out, all out An important point to note is that the rule when assessing the above is one out, all out so if a water body is at Good status in 3 of the above categories, but Poor in the 4th, the entire waterbody is judged to be Low it is the lowest result that determines status. Public Participation A key part of the Water Framework Directive is Article 14, which requires all member states to genuinely engage with the people who live, work and play in a catchment. To do this, it is important to understand how local communities live in their catchments and use their water. Therefore, it is critical that local communities are involved in management and decision making related to protecting and, where necessary, improving their water resources. Ultimately, meeting the sometimes narrow objectives of the WFD is not the aim â€“ helping communities protect and improve a beautiful and diverse landscape with accessible healthy waterways that are productively used to support livelihoods, habitats and rich wildlife is the goal. However, the WFD can be a powerful tool to help in achieving this goal.

Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management The Office of Public Works is responsible for Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management. The Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme is central to the medium to long-term strategy for the reduction and management of flood risk in Ireland. The Programme delivers on core components of the National Flood Policy , adopted in 2004, and on the requirements of the EU Floods Directive . The Irish Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management programme is being carried out in parallel with similar programmes across the European Union. The OPW is the lead agency for flood risk management in Ireland and is the national competent authority for the EU Floods Directive. The OPW works in close partnership with all Local Authorities in delivering the objectives of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Programme. Implementation of the requirements EU Floods Directive is being coordinated with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive and the current River Basin Management Plans. The Programme is also being undertaken with close cross-border coordination.

How do we manage our catchments? Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact What is a catchment, and why should I care? Home What is a catchment, and why should I care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a waterbody, with all the water ultimately running off to a single outlet. 3D depiction of a catchment We all want to have good quality schools in our local community, and living in the catchment area for a good school can help make sure children get a good education, and even add to the value of your home. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like food production, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. To protect and improve our rivers, lakes and coastal waters, we need to understand how they flow through and are connected with the diverse landscapes that surround them, and what is causing pressure on their ability to support the communities, livelihoods and ecosystems that depend on them for clean and healthy water. On this website, we have broken Ireland up into 46 larger catchments, and 583 subcatchments â€“ meaning that you can find information about your local communityâ€™s catchment easily. Ireland has been divided into 46 catchments We have also included information about what you can do to help your local community look after your water, and the catchment that drains into it. This can be as simple as a spring clean of your riverbank once a year, or something bigger like working on establishing a Locally-led Agricultural Scheme or Rivers Trust for your local community. Working together on these issues at local level has been shown to work around the world, and we have also have stories on the site from across Ireland of those who have developed community initiatives that have helped improve their quality of life, supported local livelihoods, and allowed local ecosystems to flourish.

How do we manage our catchments? Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Learn Home Learn What is a catchment, and why should you care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other waterbody. We all want to have good quality schools and hospitals in our community, as this can help with enhancing education and health, and overall quality of life. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can help make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like agriculture, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. Find out more How do we manage our catchments? Experience around the world and in Ireland has shown that working together in local partnerships with local communities, Rivers Trusts, public bodies, and others on managing individual catchments and subcatchments of a suitable size is the best way to protect and improve our water, and making sure local communityâ€™s livelihoods and health are sustained and protected into the future. To effectively manage our catchments, bottom-up and top-down collaboration is necessary. Catchments.ie will highlight stories from around Ireland showing how we can manage our rivers, lakes and coastal waters, and share the science and data that can help people make decisions, from a local Rivers Trust deciding what to do in their local area, all the way up to a government minister signing off on a River Basin Management Plan for the country. Find out more Where is my local catchment? With 46 catchments and 583 subcatchments across Ireland, your local one should be an area you are familiar with and know well. You can find your catchment and subcatchment on the Maps page â€“allowing geolocation when prompted will zoom the map straight in on where you are now. On the maps you can find information about the current status of your local rivers, lakes and beaches, information abouut how these valuable resources are being used, and the environmental pressures which may be causing problems On the Data pages you can see detailed results of scientific tests, including long-term trends.

You can also get in touch with the new Waters and Communities Office , who will be helping local communities get involved all across Ireland. A guide to the Water Framework Directive This piece of EU legislation has become a major driver for achieving sustainable management of water in Ireland and across the EU. Under this directive, all inland and coastal waters must reach â€˜Goodâ€™ ecological status. â€˜Good ecological statusâ€™ means achieving satisfactory quality water, maintaining ecosystems that can support all the species of plants, birds, fish and animals that live in these aquatic habitats. Having one Framework for water quality for all of the 4,829 waterbodies in Ireland, and all the others across Europe, allows us to compare our results, and see what works to help us make sure all our surface and ground water achieves at least Good Status, and no deterioration occurs. A key part of the Water Framework Directive is Article 14, which requires all member states to genuinely engage with the people who live, work and play in a catchment. Ultimately, meeting the objectives of the Water Framework Directive is not the aim â€“ helping communities protect and improve a beautiful and diverse landscape with accessible healthy waterways that are productively used to support local health, livelihoods, habitats and rich wildlife is the goal. The Water Framework Directive is a powerful tool to help in achieving this. Find out more This site uses cookies: Find out more. Okay, thanks Who is involved?

All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other waterbody. We all want to have good quality schools and hospitals in our community, as this can help with enhancing education and health, and overall quality of life.

Find out more Using data to help understand our catchments Managing our catchments effectively requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information. This includes: how people use the land and waterbodies, and what livelihoods are supported; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water flows both above and below ground from where it falls as rain to the sea; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. You can see lots of this information on the Maps and Data pages, which will be added to over time. These pages show information about our 46 catchments, 583 subcatchments and 4829 waterbodies. Many waterbodies have charts available for trends in key biological and chemical indicators, which can help us understand how healthy they are, and the possible causes of any changes. Find out more How to get involved with your local catchment and make a difference today While understanding what is affecting our catchments and waterbodies can help us manage them, experience from projects in Ireland and around the world has shown that local community involvement is one of the keys to long-term success. There are many ways for individuals or local communities to get involved â€“ this can be anything from organising a Spring Clean of a riverbank once a year, getting your local Tidy Towns committee to look at how your river or lake can help your town become a nicer place to live, or even establishing a Rivers Trust or locally led agri-environment scheme to help draw down funding and establish a long term plan for your area.

How do we manage our catchments? Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News Burren LIFE: Farming for Conservation Burren LIFE: Farming for Conservation June 01, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Stories The Burren region, located between Counties Clare and Galway, is a place which has long been recognised for its unusual rocky landscape, its rich wildlife and its fascinating archaeology. As with much of the Irish landscape, the Burren has been shaped over many millennia by the actions of farmers and their livestock. Supporting these farmers to sustain low-input grazing systems is a key challenge if we are to ensure the Burren maintains its exceptional natural and cultural heritage. Burren Life is a locally targeted conservation programme which tries to meet this challenge, using a novel approach which places farmers at the very centre of the conservation agenda and rewarding these farmers for their environmental performance. With 15,000ha currently under management, Burren Life has proven to be very impactful and has received much recognition in recent times for its work. Burren Landscape This perhaps belies the fact that the model is based on over 10 years of applied, farm-level research and relationship-building. The initial spark for Burren Life came from a number of local actors, most importantly farmers who felt their voices were not being heard when Special Areas of Conservation were being designated on, and Agri-environment schemes designed for, their land. A 3 year, Teagasc-funded research project ensued which told the full story of farming and the Burren, highlighting the threats posed by recent changes in farming, but emphasising that farming and environmental lobbies had more in common than was recognised. This research provided the impetus for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Teagasc and the Burren Irish Farmers Association to come together in support of an EU-LIFE funded project aimed at developing a blueprint for sustainable farming in the region. This 5 year research project, again conducted at farm level in the Burren with the full involvement of local farmers, showed a way forward which could accommodate all stakeholder interests. With appropriate scientific input from a local project team, and based on lessons learned from the local research, a bespoke model to incentivise farmers to improve the environmental health of their farm was developed. Using this model, funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Burren Life Programme (2010-2015) was introduced, its subsequent success built on the solid foundations of strong local ownership and pride, effective working partnerships, and practical science. How does Burren Life operate? Burren Life uses a novel hybrid approach to farming for conservation which sees farmers paid for both work undertaken and, most importantly, for the delivery of defined environmental objectives. Within Burren Life, farmers are helped to prepare their own simple farm plan (most only 3 pages and very visual) each year by their trained advisor and the Burren Life team. Burren Life Farm Walk The plan is tailored to suit the needs of the individual farm and outlines the two payment categories: 1. Payment for Actions The annual farm plan contains a list of actions (jobs) which are nominated by the farmer with the aim of improving the sites management and conservation condition. Each job is individually costed and co-funded by the farmer, and is carried out within the year by the farmer and/or a local contractor. Payment issues only when jobs are completed, and to a satisfactory standard. The farmer can opt-out of a planned action if he/she so chooses, ensuring maximum flexibility for the farmer. Most farms nominate a mixture of jobs to suit the needs of their land e.g. removing encroaching scrub from species-rich grassland, repairing internal walls or enhancing access. Protecting natural water sources and gathering, storing and supplying clean water are among some of the most popular jobs undertaken. Work completed over the first 6 years of the Burren Life Programme includes: 241ha of scrub (mainly hazel and blackthorn) removed across a wide area of the Burren 164km of (c.3m wide) stock paths opened through scrub to reconnect areas of grazing 112km of broken wall (gaps!) repaired and 720 new gates fitted 440 new watering points installed and scores of sensitive springs protected 55km of vehicle access tracks repaired or created, enabling improved long-term management 2. Payment for Results Every eligible field of species-rich Burren grassland and heath is assessed annually with a user-friendly habitat health checklist (one criterion used is the condition of the natural water sources in the field, for example). Each field receives a score between 1 and 10: all fields with a score greater than 3 receive payment but higher scores receive higher payments. This gives farmers the incentive to manage their fields in ways that will improve their scores and their payment as well. The results-based payment system allows farmers greater freedom to decide how to manage their land (with advice if needed) and also guarantees the taxpayer better value for money i.e. no delivery, no payment! It also generates data (see table below) which demonstrates the positive environmental impact of Burren Life. This graph shows that, between 2010 and 2015, the area of Burren grassland in very good condition (scoring >7) increased and the area in poorer condition (scoring <7) decreased. Burren Drinking Trough showing rain collection Impact of Burren Life Over the course of the first 6 years (2010-2015), Burren Life has had major environmental and socio-economic impacts in the Burren. 5.9m has been invested directly in the region, with an average of 6,500 per year going to each farmer, with the added benefit that much of this money is recycled locally. Farmers themselves have invested an additional 1.6m in the programme through co-funding of farm works, amounting to a total spend of 7.5m. This funding has contributed to a number of spin-offs such as increased work for local contractors, more custom for local shops and manufacturers (e.g. Burren gates), and new farm-based tourism enterprises. Burren Life has delivered a range of proven environmental benefits on about 14,500ha of prime Burren habitat. It has cemented strong partnerships between farmers and management agencies, helped to create a very positive attitude towards conservation among farmers, and has generated a far greater appreciation of the role of farmers by the wider community. Through this work, Burren Life has made a very meaningful and lasting contribution to the future of Irelands most extraordinary landscape, the Burren. The success of the programme has contributed to the introduction of a new 70m measure for Locally-led Agri Environment Schemes in the Rural Development Programme 2015-2020, which includes an expansion of the programme across the entire Burren (30,000ha target area) with an estimated annual budget of 3-4m.

Water is a precious resource and is essential for all life on earth. Looking after our rivers, lakes and coastal waters so they can meet our current and future needs, and also continue to support the ecosystems that depend on them, is vital for Irelandâ€™s future.

Sharing science and stories about Integrated Catchment Management in Ireland. Integrated Catchment Management is a community-led approach that aims to involve people and groups from across society. 46 Catchments 583 Subcatchments 4829 Waterbodies View Data and Dashboards What is a catchment, and why should you care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other waterbody. We all want to have good quality schools and hospitals in our community, as this can help with enhancing education and health, and overall quality of life. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can help make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like agriculture, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. Find out more Using data to help understand our catchments Managing our catchments effectively requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information. This includes: how people use the land and waterbodies, and what livelihoods are supported; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water flows both above and below ground from where it falls as rain to the sea; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. You can see lots of this information on the Maps and Data pages, which will be added to over time. These pages show information about our 46 catchments, 583 subcatchments and 4829 waterbodies. Many waterbodies have charts available for trends in key biological and chemical indicators, which can help us understand how healthy they are, and the possible causes of any changes. Find out more How to get involved with your local catchment and make a difference today While understanding what is affecting our catchments and waterbodies can help us manage them, experience from projects in Ireland and around the world has shown that local community involvement is one of the keys to long-term success. There are many ways for individuals or local communities to get involved â€“ this can be anything from organising a Spring Clean of a riverbank once a year, getting your local Tidy Towns committee to look at how your river or lake can help your town become a nicer place to live, or even establishing a Rivers Trust or locally led agri-environment scheme to help draw down funding and establish a long term plan for your area.

How do we manage our catchments? Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News Eden Demonstration Test Catchment, UK Eden Demonstration Test Catchment, UK April 02, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , Stories Introduction A two-day visit to England was made by Marie Archbold, Donal Daly, Jenny Deakin, Paddy Morris (all EPA) and Deirdre Fay (DAFM) on 29th â€“ 30th April 2015. The purpose was to learn from the work of the Eden River Trust in Cumbria and the Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) research, and the research being undertaken by the Allerton Project, run by the Game & Wildlife Conservancy in the Eye Brook catchment, Loddington, Leicestershire. Objective The main objective was to derive comparisons between catchment research and characterisation being carried out in the UK and that being carried out in Ireland by Teagasc in the Agricultural Catchments Programme and by the EPA in their Catchment Science and Management Unit. The purpose of this article is to reflect on the knowledge gained during the trip in the context of the DAFM funded Agricultural Catchments Programme, with a particular focus on the River Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (Eden DTC). The Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) The River Eden Demonstration Test Catchment (Eden DTC) is a DEFRA funded research project. The aim of the project is to assess if it is possible to cost effectively mitigate diffuse pollution from agriculture whilst maintaining agricultural productivity. The project is working in three focus catchments within the River Eden catchment, selected to represent a range of land uses, physical characteristics and weather. The focus areas are in the Dacre, Morland and Pow catchments. Each catchment has an area of approximately 10 km2. The projects involve monitoring the stream water quality and biology and looking at how the catchment responds to storm events. Working closely with farmers in the catchment to test a range of mitigation measures in real catchment situations is an important element of the project. The project aims are three fold: To produce evidence to test the hypothesis that it is possible to cost effectively reduce the impact of agricultural diffuse pollution to water on ecological function, while maintaining food security, through the implementation of multiple on farm measures. To develop a research platform to host collaborative research. To develop a common vision for catchment management centred around local knowledge and understanding. Eden Stakeholder Engagement Framework Each focus catchment was selected to represent the full range of natural and anthropogenic variation across the Eden catchment as summarised below: Morland Catchment Limestone/sandstone/mudstone Sandy clay loam/clay loam Artificial drainage 87% grassland, 71% improved Dairy/beef/sheep 1150 mm rainfall Pow Catchment Limestone/sandstone/mudstone Sandy clay loam/clay loam Artificial drainage 46% improved grassland, 37% arable Intensive dairy/beef/sheep/pigs/poultry 810 mm rainfall Dacre catchment Dacre Catchment Upland Volcanic andesite, glacial till Sandy clay loam/clay loam 80% grassland, 16% woodland Extensive sheep grazing 1570 mm rainfall Catchment pressures include intensive farming, erosion of river banks by livestock, flash flooding from hills and lowland drainage, abstraction, pollution and silting, and climate change and increasing frequency of floods and droughts. A variety of changes in farm and land management are being trialled in the Eden DTC to reduce the impacts of diffuse pollution on surface water and groundwater. These are being delivered through advice and support on soil and nutrient management, tailored to the specific geography and types of farm practice. Researchers and advisors are working with farmers to identify flow pathways, specific problems and â€˜hotspotsâ€™ such as vulnerable fields and hard standings. Catchment monitoring includes the collection and telemetry of water quality data such as phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonium, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity, water temperature, chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen, as well as hydro-meteorological data such as rainfall, river stage/flow and other meteorological parameters. In addition non-telemetered data is collected such as monthly spot samples, storm samples, biological samples, borehole levels and chemical analyses of borehole samples, soil samples, faecal indicator organism samples, farm business and farmer attitude surveys. Each focus catchment contains 2 sub-catchments, a control catchment and a mitigation catchment, each with an area of approximately 2 km2. For each mitigation sub-catchment a conceptual approach is adopted based on source, mobilisation, delivery and receptor. Eden DTC Water Framework Directive Classification Interventions being tested include: Development of nutrient management plans targeting dirty water, slurry, manure and fertiliser spreading. Working with land managers to deliver large scale investment in farm infrastructure such as slurry and silage storage and manure management processes. Installing drains, ponds, lagoons and stone barriers where required. Improvement of livestock and machinery tracks to prevent erosion and rapid transfer of pollutants to watercourses. Establishing riparian buffer strips and stream-bank fencing to exclude livestock. Fencing may be coupled with some carefully targeted additional options such as constructed wetlands, and settling ponds for sediment and associated nutrient removal. Reduced cultivation methods such as strip tillage and the use of cover crops to reduce bare soil after harvest and to take up residual nitrogen. Biobeds to reduce pesticide pollution from sprayers. The sprayers are washed down on a hard standing and the polluted water broken down in a bed of straw, soil and peat. Initial research findings are showing positive effects in the mitigation sub-catchments, with a 28%, 39%, 27%, and 31% decrease in total phosphorus, total reactive phosphate, nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen respectively, as well as a 35% increase in suspended solids. Concluding remarks A particular success of the Eden DTC of working is the close working relationship with farmers to test a range of mitigation measures in real catchment situations. This approach is an invaluable element of the project, and fosters a meaningful exchange of knowledge between researchers, advisors, farmers and policy makers. It is recommended that a similar research based mitigation approach is considered alongside the existing research based monitoring programme, in any subsequent funding of the Agricultural Catchments Programme to ensure a simultaneous focus on maximising the uptake of best management practices by farmers, as well as the development of national sustainable intensification policies.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News A smart approach to managing open drains protects water quality A smart approach to managing open drains protects water quality August 26, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , News , Research Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for crop production, but is easily mobilised to surface waters from heavy soils during rainfall and can negatively impact water-quality. To maintain Irelandâ€™s trend of improving water- quality, solutions that mitigate phosphorus transfers after mobilisation will be needed. These solutions need be economically viable and thus not place undue burden on the area of land required for production. Runoff attenuating features, such as buffer strips, ponds and wetlands, are commonly used to mitigate phosphorus transfers, however their utility is limited by small sizes in larger catchments and so a targeted approach is needed to locate them appropriately. Phosphorus loss to streams tends to be highest on farms with heavy soils and these farms are likely to have many open drains. Open drains can be considered as networks of linear runoff attenuation features but unlike buffer strips, ponds and wetlands, they do not occur on productive land and occupy larger areas. Small changes to the management of these drains could help farmers achieve production goals without impacting on water-quality. Recently, the Teagasc Agricultural Catchments Programme characterised the open drains and stream channels in two contrasting catchments (both ca. 12km2) in County Wexford; a well-drained arable catchment and a poorly-drained grassland catchment. The Agricultural Catchments Programme study found that these channels occupied 50,000m2 (0.45% of the catchment area) in the arable catchment and 150,000 m2 (1.25% of the catchment) in the poorly-drained grassland catchment. Laboratory tests showed that the sediments in the open drains had potential to trap phosphorus that had been washed off the land. That is to say the sediments could draw phosphorus out of the overlying water and lock it up. This process reduces the chances of the phosphorus moving into downstream rivers or lakes where it could cause environmental damage. Sediment itself can also directly damage rivers and lakes so any management practices that retain sediments in drain networks and returns it safely to the land would have the dual benefit of reducing both sediment and phosphorus losses downstream. For example, widening the drain would slow down the flow and encourage more sediment and phosphorus retention. This could, therefore, be considered as a management tool in particularly risky areas. Figure 1: Drains and their slopes (Teagasc Agricultural Catchments Programme) The study found that flat drains (i.e. blue drains in Figure 1) had the greatest potential to retain sediment and are therefore valuable landscape features. However, over time these flat ditches can get clogged up with sediment and the sediment can become saturated with phosphorus. Once a critical level of phosphorus saturation is reached, the sediment could release the phosphorus back into the drainage water. Regularly cleaning out ditches would ensure that this critical level of saturation is never reached. The sediment that is removed should be kept on the farm where it can be spread on a dry area away from drains to add to soil fertility and prevent it getting back into drains. To protect fish eggs and small salmonids, maintenance of drains likely to contain these species should be carried out between mid-May and mid-September. Drains with slopes greater than 2% (i.e. pink and green drains in Figure 1) were more vulnerable to sediment and phosphorus being mobilised and washed downstream during rain storms. Encouraging vegetation growth on the drain beds would help to stabilise the sediment and reduce the potential for movement during storms. The ACP has also found that streams (i.e. black channels in Figure 1) donâ€™t tend to retain much sediment due to the faster flow of water through them. However, the faster flow rates can erode a lot of the bank sediment, causing water-quality problems downstream. Planting and maintaining hedgerows alongside channels could stabilise these banks and reduce this erosion. To ensure productivity growth under FoodWise 2025 plans, better use of existing nutrients will be required overall. The smart approach to drain management suggested here will always work best in tandem with good soil nutrient management planning to ensure maximum crop availability and minimum losses in runoff and leaching.

Our project, entitled the â€œPlight of the Pearlsâ€�, investigated the factors that affect the distribution of the freshwater pearl mussel along the River Allow, a tributary of the River Blackwater in North County Cork. Of the factors that we investigated where mussels were present, we found that substrate size and siltation were the two factors that affected their distribution; depth of the water, distance of the mussels from the river bank, macro-habitat type, pH and temperature values and light intensity were all found not to have a significant impact. Total absence of pearl mussels in certain locations was associated with pollution discharges. Our project won the 3rd prize in the Biological and Ecological Sciences, Intermediate (Group), category, a major achievement for us and something we hope will contribute in a meaningful way to the saving of the pearl mussel. Young Scientists and their teacher on the cover of the March 2016 Catchments Newsletter We first came across the freshwater pearl mussel in primary school. Dr Fran Igoe came to our schools to talk about our river and this was our first exposure to the species. Opting to work with Fran and the LIFE+ team for our project was an easy decision as not only was the mussel something of relevance to us as local people, a fact highlighted to us by the LIFE+ Projectâ€™s visit. We are extremely grateful to Fran Igoe, John Ballinger and Nuala Riordan for their assistance and advice during our project and our science teacher Mr Derry Oâ€™Donovan. At the exhibition itself, we met many members of the public who had either never heard of the pearl mussel or who only had scant information regarding the species. We were delighted to get the opportunity to talk to these people about the mussels and to explain to them how important it is that we conserve them in rivers where they remain. The awareness we raised through the undertaking of the project among our fellow students, our families, our friends and indeed members of the wider community was something we were delighted and we found that, while people might not have heard of the mussels before, they were delighted to learn about them and listened with interest. We intend to enter our project into the ECO-UNESCO Young Environmentalistâ€™s Awards at the end of February. This will bring further awareness to the â€œplight of the pearlsâ€� and we hope that all our work will make a difference in this area.

Identifying Pressures: Water is an essential commodity: human life and indeed all life on earth depends upon it. The question is how will we deal with it such that it sustains us now and in the future? Effective water management is critical to the future well-being of Irish society. We need an adequate supply of good quality, safe water Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for drinking, to protect biodiversity under the Habitats and Birds Directives, to obtain â€˜good qualityâ€™ status for all waterbodies as specified by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), and for industrial and agricultural use, especially in the context of Food Harvest 2020 (FH2020) goals. Informing Policy: The Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) approach has been proposed (Harris, 2013; Daly, 2013) as being required to achieve effective water and catchment management, and implement the WFD. A key focus in ICM is developing a vision for the catchment, by involving local stakeholders. Article 14 of the WFD also specifies that consultation and involvement of the public be included as part of implementation, but EU WFD guidance states no blue-print exists for public participation, and the public participation process should be organised and adapted to national, regional and local circumstances. This study provides a practical guide to what works when engaging local communities around Ireland. Developing Solutions: Broadening the scope of possible management strategies by including different interests and stakeholder groups helps policy makers to develop flexible ways of managing the environment. This small scale study draws on StreamScapes 25 years of experience of delivering environmental education programmes around Ireland, focused on the aquatic environment and biodiversity. StreamScapes have helped local populations understand these issues at catchment scale. This report details the techniques they have developed for public engagement, and recommendations for the future. You can download the full report for free from the EPA website.

They are the only member of the lobster family living in our freshwaters. They grow to approximately 10-15cms in length and have large sharp claws for defence and feeding. They require water with high calcium concentrations in order to maintain and grow their hard shells, so are typically found in limestone regions. Ireland has only one species, the White Clawed Crayfish ( Austropotamobius pallipes ) and large populations can be found in many areas. White Clawed Crayfish They are mainly nocturnal and seek refuge under stones, logs and vegetation where they enjoy a varied diet of insects and plants. They are known to be cannibalistic, particularly the larger adults. They can survive for up to ten years and are important prey items for otters, fish and birds on our waterways. Historically found across most of Europe, White Clawed crayfish populations have seen massive declines in the last hundred years â€“ to the point where it is now extinct in many parts of Europe. This global decline can be attributed to many issues â€“habitat destruction, pollution, overfishing- but primarily to competition from non-native species, particularly the North American Signal Crayfish ( Pacifastacus leniusculus ,). The Signal Crayfish was introduced across Europe for aquaculture (it is much bigger then the native species) but escapees, and its use by fishermen as bait, has led to its rapid establishment across most of the white-clawed range. Being bigger and more aggressive, the Signal Crayfish outcompetes the native species for habitat and food (much like the grey squirrel outcompetes the native red squirrel) restricting it to isolated areas and resulting in large population declines. Most worrying of all, the Signal crayfish is a carrier of the crayfish plague, which it is immune to â€“but the native species has no immunity at all. The plague is a fungal infection ( Aphanomyces astaci ) which spreads rapidly and leads to total wipeout of infected individuals within two weeks of exposure. While the Signal crayfish is the original source of the infection, the fungal spores can then be carried by other animals (otters/mink/migrating birds etc) into new watercourses. The transfer of boats between river/lakes and the movement of watersport enthusiasts and fishermen are thought to transmit the fungus. Once the actual fungus is introduced into a waterway, it spreads quickly and without assistance. The natural movement of the water will transport the spores downstream and infected crayfish will move the disease upstream. Terrestrial animals, bathing, fishing and boating activities will also accelerate the diffusion of the plague driving our native crayfish to the brink of extinction. The disease is rapid and fatal, with few clinical symptoms. Often the only evidence of its presence is the appearance of hundreds or thousands of dead and dying crayfish on the lake shore or river bank. Infected specimens may exhibit unusual behaviour a few days before death, such as appearing during daylight hours, wandering out of the water and walking strangely due to paralysis. White tufts of fungus may or may not be visible on the body. White Clawed Crayfish in Ireland Only the native white clawed crayfish has been recorded in Ireland to date and as such we are unique in Europe in having no alien crayfish species present â€“yet. As a result, Ireland has the largest and most important remaining populations of white clawed crayfish in Europe, where it is listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, and is also listed under Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. Despite the absence of its competitor, the signal crayfish, crayfish plague has been confirmed in Ireland on several occasions since the 1980â€™s with some areas losing all their crayfish stocks (Lough Lene, Lough Bane, Lough Sheelin, Lough White (crayfish since reintroduced by NPWS), Lough Owel, parts of Inny catchment, parts of Boyne Catchment etc), the fungal spores suspected to come from infected nets, gear, boats or migrant birds. This latest confirmed outbreak in Co Cavan (on a tributary of the River Erne) has led to fears of the plague spreading rapidly and wiping out our remaining stocks of this protected native species. Signal Crayfish (note red claws) What can we do As responsible water-users, the most important thing we can do is limit the spread of the fungal spores. Crayfish plague spores can be spread on damp equipment such as fishing tackle, boots, canoes and machinery. Do not move any equipment that has been in contact with river or lake water without either disinfecting (iodine based disinfectant) or washing (clean tap water) and then drying completely. If you see any signal crayfish (see photo below) or anyone in possession of, or attempting to trap, release or sell live crayfish, please report to NPWS or IFI. Similarly, if you notice any numbers of dead/dying native crayfish please also report it. Crayfish Plague (tips from BugLife UK ) Follow these simple tips and you can help to stop the spread of crayfish plagueâ€¦ Definitely: â€“ Dry all wet and muddy equipment used in rivers and lakes for several days Try to : â€“ Thoroughly washing all wet and muddy gear and then dry for several days Or: â€“ Disinfect with a suitable disinfectant (e.g. domestic bleach, an iodine-based disinfectant, FAM30, Virkon or others). Clean off any mud before using a disinfectant and make sure you dispose of the left over disinfectant carefully so it doesnâ€™t cause any pollution to waters. Anglers try to avoid fishing different rivers or other water bodies on the same day, but if you do then disinfect all wet gear between sites. It helps prevent the spread of diseases and parasites of fish too. If there is an outbreak of crayfish plague in a river, avoid going into the water if at all if possible. When there are dead and dying White-claws the risk of spreading crayfish plague is hugely increased.

The Irish Peatland Conservation Council (IPCC) gathered a large amount of essential information about the nature of the bog and the diversity of wildlife living on the site. This material will be an invaluable help in preparing a conservation plan for the bog later this year. The species count for Coad Bog BioBlitz was 200 with 304 hours of observations from participants. The Blitz included hands on visits by all the children in Caherdaniel National School. Participants combed the bog observing and recording as many plant and animal species as possible. Veteran BioBlitzer Ken Bond collected moths and other insects as part of the Blitz and even helped volunteers identify eggs of the Orange-tip Butterfly. The BioBlitz put a spotlight on the value of science in Irish peatlands and offered a unique opportunity for the public to learn first-hand how important science is in managing peatlands for the future. The top ten highlights of the BioBlitz included: Over 200 different species recorded on the site including birds, moths, butterflies, spiders, beetles, slugs, dragonflies, damselflies, mammals, flowering plants, mosses and liverworts. Rory Hodd a bryophyte expert recorded a massive 71 species of mosses and liverworts on the bog. One species called Anomolous Flapwort was a rare find for County Kerry; it has only been recorded once before in Kerry and is usually found in the raised bogs of the Irish midlands. The song of the Skylark could be heard and enjoyed by all during the week and some volunteers had the pleasure of observing a Meadow Pipit nest. The Pygmy Shrew Irelandâ€™s smallest mammal was also recorded on the site. It consumes 1.25 times its body weight daily in beetles, spiders, bugs and woodlice to survive. This is due to its extremely small size and high metabolic rate. 13 different habitats were found on the 10 acre site. These included wet bog, grassland, rocky outcrop, bog ditch and stream. The most diverse of these habitats was a stream that contained 22 different species of plant. Other rich habitats on the site included; the Molina grassland habitat and the Sphagnum rich typical blanket bog habitat in the centre of the bog, each of which contained 15 species. The deepest peat recorded in the bog was 4 m. A peat core showed that Coad Bog formed directly on rocky soil with Old Red Sandstone boulders. It is likely that parts of the bog may be up to 7,000 years old. Some 4,000 year old pine stumps were spotted throughout the bog. The stumps were exposed in the 19 th century during turf cutting. Some of these pine stumps appeared black in colour due burning of the bog in the past. The water levels recorded on the bog ranged from 1.5cm to 75 cm below the surface. These readings reflect the different habitats found on the bog with the lower readings being recorded in the central area of the bog which was the typical swampy blanket bog habitat and the higher readings being recorded in the drier habitats around the edge of the bog and near rocky outcrops. The pH on the site ranged from 5.1 recorded in a bog pool to 6.8 recorded in the stream. The students from Caherdaniel National School enjoyed an educational visit on Coad Bog. The children explored methods of recording wildlife on the bog. They also learnt how to measure peat depth and water levels allowing them to become junior wildlife rangers. All of the children and teachers enjoyed their visit and discovered the beauty and value of blanket bog habitats. Over 100 people visited the bog during the BioBlitz event. This included 28 volunteers and 32 people from the local community who attended a Night Safari on the site. A total of 304 volunteer hours were contributed to the BioBlitz from 28 different volunteers taking part in wildlife surveys and conservation management throughout activities. Volunteers from Kerry were joined by others from Dublin, Kildare and Cork. The IPCC would like to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to all who took part in the Coad Bog BioBlitz. â€˜ It was a fantastic week full of exciting discoveries. It was brilliant to meet with the local people and hear about the history of the area. The local people were so friendly and supportive, we couldnâ€™t have asked for a better welcome to County Kerry â€™ â€“ Katie Geraghty, IPCCâ€™s Campaign Officer. The BioBlitz event was made possible through sponsorship by the Environmental Protection Agency under their EPA Research Programme 2014-2020 and supported by the Irish Environmental Network under their Biodiversity Events Funding 2016 and the IPCCâ€™s Friends of the Bog.

August 18, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , Get involved , News , Water and Communities Great turnouts and lively discussions were the order of the day for the recent River Suir community meetings. Over two weeks in July, evening meetings were held at six riverside locations throughout the River Suir catchment, specifically to ask local people â€œWhat does the River Suir mean to you?â€�. Meetings were held in both Tipperary and Kilkenny at the following locations: Â· Newcastle Community Hall, Tuesday 19th Â· Golden Community Hall, Wednesday 20th Â· Thurles, Anner Hotel, Thursday 21st Â· Cahir House Hotel, Tuesday 26th Â· Fethard Community Hall, Wednesday 27th Â· Piltown, Kildalton College, Thursday 28th The main purpose of the evening meetings was to open out the discussion on the Suir into water quality and other natural water issues, and explore opportunities that the Suir and its tributaries can provide to local communities. These meetings were organised by the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office to coincide with public consultations by the Office of Public Works on the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study. The meetings opened with a presentation by Fran Igoe who gave the background to this new approach to the management of our natural waters, that include rivers, lakes, groundwater, estuaries, the coast and wetlands. The importance of the River Suir from a European perspective was explained, including why it was selected as a Special Area of Conservation on account of the myriad of wildlife it supports. The meetings were then opened to the floor and attendees were invited to contribute on the benefits and issues relating to the rivers from the local perspective. Needless to say this was a lively affair at all venues with discussions ranging from sewage present in the river and excessive vegetation growth; to access restrictions for walkers and the potential for river based tourism development. #gallery-2 { margin: auto; } #gallery-2 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-2 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-2 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */ Biodiversity Signage at Fethard â€“ communities working to create awareness of wildlife along their local river.

Cahir House Hotel â€“ Discussing the various issues along the River Suir at Cahir and Ardfinnin. Following this discussion there was an overview of the structure and role of the national Waters and Communities Office and the draft River Basin Management Plan which will be available nationally for public consultation from December 2016 to June 2017. In Cahir the meeting started with a short workshop by Dr Craig Bullock of UCD who explained his research into the â€˜ecosystem servicesâ€™ provided by Irish rivers. Ecosystem services essentially are the range of benefits we derive from nature. Thus in the context of rivers these include water supply for drinking, farming and industry, fishing, amenity, and tourism. The biology of the river and how it deals with waste and nutrients was also touched upon during this presentation. A key objective of the meetings was to explore the potential and opportunities for local communities to become more involved in the management of the River Suir, its tributaries and the wider catchment. It was acknowledged at the meetings that there is currently great work being undertaken by groups such as Workmans Boat Club in Clonmel, Crabra Wetlands near Thurles, numerous Angling clubs, River Rescue and Tidy Towns Committees right throughout the catchment. All of which is very encouraging and shows the potential for community involvement in initiatives that can make a real difference for the benefit of rivers and the communities connected with them. Internationally it is recognised that if a river is in a healthier state it will support more aquatic life and in turn benefit the economic development of an area. Fran Igoe stressed the point â€œwhat is needed is long term support for the excellent work being carried out by local communities, encouragement for more people to get involved and reconnect with the river, and ultimately for groups to network and work together throughout the wider River Suir catchmentâ€�. This isnâ€™t that radical a concept when you think about it, as historically the river connected communities from Waterford upstream, probably all the way to Templemore. By taking a broader view of the Suir catchment it is clear that there are opportunities to improve not just water quality and wildlife habitats but also amenity and tourism value, whilst still dealing with flooding issues. Some might say â€œthatâ€™s all well and good, but weâ€™ve heard this before?â€� or â€œcan anything really be done about the issues?â€� Being realistic, some of the issues raised at the meetings will require major infrastructural investment, such as to providing a new or upgraded waste water treatment facilities and this will not be an easy problem to solve. Other issues can be solved through local effort and some with little funding. All issues raised at the meetings will be forwarded by the Waters and Communities Office to the relevant public authorities and feedback will then be given to the community from where the issue was raised. Importantly, all issues will be compiled for a River Suir Catchment submission to the draft â€˜River Basin Management Planâ€™ in December 2016. The River Basin Management Plan will outline the issues affecting the status or quality of our natural waters and put forward a programme of measure for dealing with them over the following four years. In the interim local communities and local authorities are being urged to consider the flood relief measures being proposed by the Office of Public Works as there may also be opportunities for proposed works to be designed in such a way that there can be additional community benefits, for example river walks, viewing points or canoe access incorporated into proposed flood management options. The overall attendance at the evening meetings exceeded expectations and the discussions continued long after the meetings as people chatted over a cup of tea. This provided opportunity for networking and sharing of experiences of the river between the different groups present. Future catchment meetings and inaugural annual Suir Catchment Communities Showcase There was broad agreement that an annual event should be organised for the River Suir showcasing the work carried out by communities throughout the river catchment. This meeting is now being planned for Ardfinnan on Sunday September 25th 2016 from 2 â€“ 6 pm. Further River Suir catchment meetings will take place in late August/ early September as per table below.

Results from nutrient load apportionment modelling August 19, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , News , Research Imagine you are out for a walk along the river Suir, and stop for tea and a delicious slice of pie. Later that week you try to recreate the pie at home. You think you know the ingredients, but how do you know what amounts of each to use? And what if you miss a key ingredient? Pie Photo: Wikicommons In a similar manner, we can monitor the nutrients in the river, but it is not so easy to determine exactly where they came from. Some sources are easy to identify, such as discharges from waste water treatment plants and industry that are piped into the water. Other sources of nutrients may be less visible, and reach the river via groundwater. Even if the possible sources are identified, how can we tell what proportions they contributed to the total quantities found in the river? Previously, methods have calculated the piped, or â€˜pointâ€™, discharges, and estimated that the remaining nutrient are from â€˜diffuseâ€™ sources, typically agriculture. The issue with this approach is that the total in-stream load is actually an estimate which can have errors and, importantly, there may be other unknown point or diffuse sources contributing nutrients. To overcome this, a data-driven model has been developed for predicting the sources of nutrient loads (phosphorus and nitrogen) to water by the EPA CatchmentTools Project. The Source Loading Apportionment Model (SLAM) uses the best national data and research to quantify nutrient losses from both point discharges (urban waste water, industry and septic tank systems) and diffuse sources (pasture, arable, forestry, peatlands etc.). This model integrates catchment data and pressure information to enable characterisation of Source-Pathway- Receptor relationships. Hydro(geo)logical controls have a strong impact on nutrient fluxes, particularly in agricultural catchments, and have been incorporated into the diffuse agricultural Results show that the variation in the sources of phosphorus across the Suir generally reflects the locations of populated areas. Urban waste water accounts for between 1% to 90% of phosphorus in subcatchments of the Suir. Pasture is the other main source of phosphorus (see the other pieces of the pies below ). There is a lot less variation in the sources of nitrogen, with pasture being the dominant source across all sub-catchments in the Suir. Sources of phosphorus in the Suir subcatchments Where rivers and lakes are impacted by excess nutrients, we need to understand the sources of those nutrients before mitigation measures can be selected. In these areas, modelling can be used in conjunction with knowledge from local authorities and investigative assessments to identify significant pressures that contribute excessive nutrients to surface waters. In the Suir catchment, only a relatively small proportion of the catchment requires a reduction in phosphorus emissions to achieve Good Status. Modelling future scenarios can support catchment scientists and managers in identifying appropriate options for measures. Just as pie making isnâ€™t an exact science, modelling the sources of river nutrients can have errors and unknowns. Nonetheless, we can use these results to help support decision making and the integrated catchment management process and, ultimately, to improve our ecosystems and environment.

How chemical monitoring of our rivers can help us understand their story â€“ why, what, where and when. August 22, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , News Why Monitor? Water does not exist in its pure form in the natural environment, it is truly reflective of its surroundings, influenced by where it originates, what it flows over and percolates through. Under natural conditions the chemical characteristics of our water bodies originate from a variety of sources, including leaching of soils, weathering of minerals and atmospheric inputs. These chemicals, in both dissolved and particulate forms, reach the water body via a number of pathways, and in the case of surface water have resulted in a natural background level of chemical constituents in which aquatic biota have developed. Water quality monitoring is fundamental in the management of water resources that support healthy and productive aquatic ecosystems as well as sustainable and healthy water supplies and chemistry monitoring is an integral part of any water monitoring programme. Analysis of chemical parameters in water bodies allows for the identification of substances that are present in the aquatic environment above their natural levels, as well as the existence and concentrations of synthetic compounds. Chemical monitoring of water bodies in Ireland is undertaken by a number of different organisations. Monitoring for identified chemical compounds highlights any significant changes or trends that may be evident in water bodies over a period of time. Trending of monitoring data facilitates the identification of pressures placed on the aquatic system that may be resultant of long or short term developments. Focused monitoring programmes can help target the source of a pressure and help inform the measures that require implementation to reduce concentrations to levels that no longer impact on water quality. Review of chemical monitoring data can also be used to determine the relative success of applied measures. What is monitored? The Water Framework Directive has identified the necessity for all of our water bodies, rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters, ground waters, and protected areas to be treated equally in terms of attaining at least â€˜Goodâ€™ status for all, and maintaining â€˜Highâ€™ status where it exists. This consolidated approach has ensured that water quality is of integral importance in current practices and future developments. Evidence-based metrics have been developed to determine the current status of water bodies and whether a water body is at risk of not achieving â€˜Goodâ€™ status. In the case of surface waters these metrics or Environmental Quality Standards specify an absolute concentration or range for a water quality element. In terms of chemical parameters these standards fall into one of three classes: 1. Physico-Chemical conditions supporting biological elements This group includes chemical properties such as pH (acidity/alkalinity), Dissolved Oxygen and Nutrients, the natural levels of which may be adversely impacted upon by human activities. 2. Specific Relevant Pollutants This group of compounds are defined as substances that can have a harmful effect on biological quality which are identified as being discharged in significant quantities into Irish waters. 3. Priority Substances These substances are identified by the Water Framework Directive as substances that present a significant general risk to, or via the aquatic environment, and include chemicals, certain metals, biocides, plant protection products and dioxins. Specific measures must be implemented for the progressive reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of these substances. This group of compounds includes a subset of Priority Hazardous Substances for which measures must be taken to stop or phase out discharges, emissions and losses. In the case of 1 and 2 above the Environmental Quality Standards are derived and applied at a member state level, so Ireland sets a standard for water bodies here based on the best available science, and compliance with these standards is a determinant in the assessment of Ecological Status. These standards can be supplemented and amended as required nationally. In the case of the Priority Substances, the Environmental Quality Standards are identified and reviewed under European Directive and are transposed into individual member state legislation, and compliance with these standards is used in the determination of Chemical Status. A combination of both Ecological Status and Chemical Status is used to determine the overall Water Framework Directive status that is applied to a water body. All chemical Environmental Quality Standards for surface waters in Ireland are set out in European Union Environmental Objectives (Surface Waters) (Amendment) Regulations 2015. Chemical analysis of our water bodies also has a role to play in the determining the environmental occurrence of Emerging Pollutants. These are chemical compounds that are not subject to Water Framework Directive regulations but have the potential to enter the aquatic environment and are suspected or known to have adverse ecological and/or human health effects. These compounds can originate from a number of different sectors such as municipal/domestic waste waters, agriculture and industrial emissions. The Water Framework Directive mechanism by which these emerging pollutants are assessed is via a â€˜Watch Listâ€™ whereby compounds are identified to be included in a member state wide monitoring programme to assess the occurrence and prevalence of these compounds in surface waters. This monitoring programme will determine whether the compounds included in the Watch List need to be added as Priority Substances and an Environmental Quality Standard determined. The First Watch List includes compounds such as estrogens, herbicides, pesticides, anti-inflammatory drugs, a sunscreen ingredient and an anti-oxidant. Suir Catchment WFD River Chemistry Monitoring Sites Where and when are rivers monitored? Chemical analysis included in the Water Framework Directive monitoring programme is based on a network of operational and surveillance monitoring locations which also include provision for the monitoring of river sites identified under the OSPAR Convention1 and Freshwater Fish Directive. Operational monitoring is used to determine pressures and apply status at a water body level. Surveillance monitoring locations also inform at a water body level, but due to their spatial distribution nationally can be used in the efficient and effective design of future monitoring programmes, the assessment of long-term changes in natural conditions and the assessment of long-term changes resulting from widespread human activity. Chemical analysis of operational monitoring locations consists of the general physico- chemical parameters and is carried out at least once a quarter on an annual basis. Monitoring of surveillance locations includes the analysis of the general physico-chemical parameters on a monthly basis and one year in the river basin management plan cycle (i.e. one year out of six) will also be monitored monthly for Priority Substances and Specific Relevant Pollutants. Supplemental monitoring and analysis in the form of investigative monitoring may also be undertaken to ascertain the magnitude and impacts of accidental pollution events, as well as helping pinpoint the causes and likely sources of longer term pollution problems. The national river monitoring network consists of 1461 operational and 180 surveillance monitoring stations, with some rivers incorporating multiple stations. In the case of the Suir catchment there are 145 Operational and 8 Surveillance River Chemistry monitoring sites as shown below. In conclusion, chemical monitoring of our rivers is a vital tool in assessing the current state of these water bodies, as well as helping to identify pressures that may be impacting on the water quality. Chemical monitoring of rivers is not a rigid instrument of assessment, it is flexible and influenced by the often changing pressures impacting on water bodies. Quality Standards, monitoring locations and chemicals monitored are routinely reviewed and adjusted where technically feasible, in line with the best available science, to ensure the best assessment of our river waters.

The EPA Water Quality in Ireland (2010-12) Report highlighted that 53% of suspected causes of pollution in rivers are from agriculture while 34% are from municipal sources. In the Suir catchment, significant pressures have been identified in 66 (34%) of the surface water bodies, with agriculture a significant pressure in 36 (19%) of the water bodies. Agricultural pressures can arise from point sources, for example, farmyards, or diffuse sources most often associated with land spreading of fertilizers (organic and inorganic). While farmyards (and septic tank systems) are easy to identify as potential pressures, diffuse sources are much more difficult to locate. As the philosophy being followed to improve our water quality where needed is â€œthe right measure in the right placeâ€�, investigative assessments are being recommended as the means of locating the significant pressures (see article page 20), including from diffuse sources. To help reduce the amount of investigative assessments required and therefore the time and resources needed, a Catchment Characterisation Tool has been developed to produce Pollution Impact Potential (PIP) maps that show the potential critical source areas for agricultural diffuse nutrients in our water bodies and subcatchments. The Pollution Impact Potential maps rank the relative risk areas for diffuse phosphorus to surface water and diffuse nitrogen to surface and groundwater. These maps are now available to all public bodies on the WFD Application. What are Critical Source Areas? Critical sources areas are areas that deliver a disproportionally high amount of pollutants compared to other areas of a water body or subcatchment, and represent the areas with the highest risk of impacting a water body. In order to determine where critical source areas are located, we need to determine the hydro(geo) logical susceptibility of the water body and also the nutrient loadings applied to that water body. Critical Source Area Conceptual Model Susceptibility Maps High hydro(geo)logically susceptible areas are areas from which nutrients have a high probability of reaching a water body of interest due to the underlying hydrogeological conditions, that is the areas that have significant pathway linkages from the source of pollution or pressure to surface water or groundwater receptors. Susceptibility maps are generated by linking data on soils, subsoils, groundwater vulnerability and aquifer types with nutrient attenuation and transport factors. These maps are now available for phosphate along the near surface pathway, and for nitrate along the near surface and groundwater pathways. The map below shows the susceptibility map for phosphate along the near surface pathway for the Suir Catchment. The darker areas (or Very High and High categories) are areas that are most susceptible to transporting phosphate along the near surface water pathway to rivers and lakes. You can find national susceptibility maps on catchments.ie/maps Near Surface Phosphate Susceptability Pollution Impact Potential Maps The susceptibility maps are combined with nutrient loadings data provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Central Statistics Office to produce Pollutant Impact Potential maps. The Pollutant Impact Potential map for phosphate to surface water for the Suir Catchment is shown below. The darkest blue areas (PIP rank 1) are the critical sources areas (or the highest risk areas) and all areas are ranked relative to this area. These high risk areas for phosphate to surface water coincide with poorly drained areas, meaning that in these areas phosphate is more likely to flow overland to surface waters rather than being retained in the soil and subsoil. Similar maps are available for nitrate in surface water and groundwater. How should Pollution Impact Potential maps be used? In the catchment areas of water bodies with unsatisfactory water quality, Pollution Impact Potential maps have been developed to help focus on the areas and sources that might be causing the impacts. They act as a first step in the characterisation process by targeting areas for further Investigative Assessment at a water body and subcatchment scale. They are available at a maximum scale of 1:20,000 (e.g. water body scale) and are not designed or suitable to be used on their own as a basis for decisions at a farm or field scale. Where diffuse agriculture is considered to be a significant pressure, Investigative Assessment enabling site and field-based assessment should be focused initially in the high risk (Pollution Impact Potential rank) areas i.e. the critical source areas. The maps act as a signpost to where there is a potential critical source area. However, the location of farmland in critical source areas does not necessarily mean that they are a significant pressure, as best management practices may already be in place. For phosphate, point sources are more likely to be an issue in high risk areas (PIP Rank 1-3) as these areas are likely to have a higher density of drains and ditches acting as a pathway from farmyards to water bodies. The public bodies responsible for Investigative Assessments will â€˜ground truthâ€™ the maps and liaise with farmers and agricultural advisors to further refine the locations of the diffuse sources using farm scale information such as nutrient management plans. The outcome of this process will inform where mitigation measures are required, and what the most appropriate measure is likely to be.

What do we need to do? The answer may be simple in theory, but can be difficult in practice â€“ we walk the stream, putting on our detectiveâ€™s hat, and look for clues using a variety of techniques from different relevant disciplines. We can then pin down the issue(s) of concern, and conclude on what might be done about it. It might be asked, if the answer is that simple, has it not been done before? Well, it has, but resources have not always been available to do all that was needed, using all possible techniques. Also, the background information needed â€“ on the physical setting, hydrochemistry, land-use, etc. â€“ was not readily available until recently with the development of the EPA Water Framework Application. The Starting Point â€“ Water Framework Directive Characterisation The WFD characterisation process being undertaken by the EPA in collaboration with local authorities involves three tiers of assessment: Preliminary water body risk screening. Initial subcatchment and catchment characterisation. Further characterisation. The first two tiers are desk-based using: a broad range of ecological, hydrochemical and hydrogeological maps and data; information on pressures, e.g. Urban Waste Water Treatment Plants, farming, septic tank systems, forestry; results from load apportionment modelling; pollution impact potential maps; and results of previous investigative monitoring and inspections undertaken by local authorities. Preliminary risk screening is undertaken nationally and identifies the water bodies that are At Risk or Not at Risk, based mainly on the available monitoring data, including assessments of status, trends and distance to threshold. The initial characterisation process then confirms this identification, and focuses on water bodies that are At Risk (i.e. those requiring additional mitigation measures to be undertaken) and provides conclusions on the main issues, the significant pressures, and the proposed environmental objectives and associated measures. However, while large point sources, such as waste water discharges, can be located and assessed readily, it is frequently not possible to locate and evaluate the significant pressures impinging on water quality in rural areas at this stage of characterisation. In these instances, further characterisation is necessary; without this, rectifying water quality problems is not feasible. This is where Investigative Assessments fit into the process of managing our water resources effectively. Further Characterisation: The Investigative Assessment Approach There are two overriding principles: Investigative Assessments follow the Source (or pressure)-Pathway-Receptor (S-P-R) model for environmental management. (These are easy words to write down, but visualising each component, and the connections between them in a 3D landscape, is essential). The level of investigation is proportional to the risk posed. Three levels of assessment are proposed: Desk study, based on existing information, such as in the WFD Application, Google Earth and websites such as www.gsi.ie, www.opw. ie and http://gis.epa.ie/Envision. Field-based assessment, mainly by local authority staff. Specialist input, such as from hydrogeologists, agricultural scientists and biologists. In this brief article, I will concentrate on the field- based assessment in At Risk stream catchments, although a desk-based assessment should always be undertaken prior to a catchment walk. As a hydrogeologist, I admit that I inevitably â€˜seeâ€™ this work through â€˜groundwater/geologistâ€™ eyes, so make allowances! But, wearing my detectiveâ€™s hat as well, I start by asking myself what field techniques from the various relevant disciplines â€“ e.g., hydrogeology, hydrology, agricultural science, hydromorphology, engineering, biology, hydrochemistry, social science â€“ would be relevant. Based on my own limited experience and input from colleagues in the Catchments Unit, the following information can be readily collected as part of a stream Investigative Assessment: Information and views of farmers and other householders. Location and description of potential point pollution sources, such as farmyards, septic tank systems, rural industries. Information on land-use, as a means of assessing potential â€˜diffuseâ€™ or non-point pressures. Clear buffer zones, riparian areas and, in the case of arable land, uncultivated setback areas alongside streams. Presence/absence of fences and hedges alongside streams. Indicators of water movement, such as drains/ditches, drainage density, poaching by farm animals, slope, evidence of land drains, and vegetation indicators such as rushes. Rock outcrops and relevant details derived from soil/subsoil exposures. Observation of hydromorphological issues, including new land reclamation, drainage, silting and stream channel maintenance. Field measurements of water conductivity, temp, Dissolved Oxygen and pH (acidity/ alkalinity) â€“ see article page 22. Small Stream Risk Score assessments. Soil sampling and testing results, with nutrient management planning evaluation. Physico-chemical and chemical sampling, and subsequent analyses. Tracing to check connections with potential pollution sources and receptors (e.g., with dye). Taking soil samples by hand augering and trial pitting, as relevant, as a means of checking the soil and subsoil characteristics, and depth to bedrock. This information can then be used to tell the â€˜storyâ€™ of the stream in sufficient detail to enable a 3D understanding of water and contaminant movement and attenuation in the site/area, followed by ideas and proposals to mitigate the pressures on the stream. On the face of it, this all seems obvious and simple. But, in my view, it isnâ€™t! Few people, including myself, have the broad range of expertise and experience to undertake all the above adequately as an integrated and holistic process. For instance, I donâ€™t have sufficient basic biological knowledge, and I am conscious in writing this that there are biological indicators not mentioned above because I donâ€™t know what they are precisely, but that with some brief training a non-specialist like myself could use. Investigative Assessments â€“ The Future The Catchments Unit, in consultation with the Environment Section of Tipperary County Council, has developed draft guidance on Investigative Assessments. In addition, we have produced an Excel spreadsheet to enable local authorities to estimate the staff resources needed to undertake Investigative Assessments in their county. For instance, the estimated resources that would be needed by Tipperary County Council to undertake Investigative Assessments is three person- years. This guidance is a â€˜work in progressâ€™, and is unlikely to be completed until early 2017. In recent days, the EPAâ€™s Ecological Monitoring & Assessment Unit has provided practical guidance for sampling lakes. Guidance on Investigative Assessments for towns/urban areas and high status water bodies are being developed; Investigative Assessment guidance for the zones of contribution of impacted wells and springs will be developed in the coming months, as will some techniques for assessing biological indicators. We also need to produce practical guidance on assessing the pathways for water and potential associated contaminants on land close to streams and ditches, particularly in poorly draining areas, and on the role of ditches themselves. However, guidance on its own wonâ€™t be enough â€“ the resources to undertake Investigative Assessments will be essential. In conclusion, we need to be able to tell â€˜what exactly the situation isâ€™ â€“ general statements on the problems are inadequate. Where the answer isnâ€™t known, Investigative Assessments are needed to provide it.

The quality of these waters and the wildlife habitats they sustain play an important part in many aspects of our lives. Much of our recreation time is spent on or around water, whether itâ€™s fishing, boating or simply walking along a beach or a river bank. We use water on a daily basis in our homes and our hotels, on our farms and in our factories, in our cities and our towns. Our very existence depends on the availability of water. As such, we all have a vested interest in the management of our waters and areas around them, which are referred to as catchments. A water catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other water body, such as groundwater. These areas are not defined by the administrative boundaries we normally associate with our counties and therefore ownership and responsibility for the management of these waters must lie with their local communities. The national Local Authority Waters and Communities Office has been established to deliver two key objectives: to coordinate the activities of all 31 local authorities in areas relevant to the Water Framework Directive and to carry out public consultation and engagement with communities and stakeholders, as required by the Directive. The office is operated by Kilkenny and Tipperary County Councils on a local authority shared services basis, and is headed up by Matt Shortt, Director of Services, Tipperary County Council and assisted by Carol McCarthy, A/Senior Engineer, Environment Section, Kilkenny County Council. A staff compliment has now been appointed which includes: Bernie Oâ€™Flaherty, Regional Coordinator, Border Region and links with Northern Ireland. Based in Carrick-on-Shannon. Ray Spain, Regional Coordinator, Mid Region (East-West). Based in Tullamore. Dr Fran Igoe, Regional Coordinator, Southern Region. Based in Clonmel. The three specialist support officers, based in the Clonmel office are: Sheevaun Thompson, Funding Lead; Alan Walsh, Communications and Marketing Lead and Michael Pollard, Technology and Research Lead. The Waters and Communities team In addition, there will be a network of twelve Community Water Officers located in centres throughout the Republic of Ireland and a recruitment process for these is currently underway. So far the Local Authority Waters and Communities Office has set about meeting with local authorities through various fora such as Strategic Policy Committee meetings, Management Team Meetings and Regional Information Sessions. Initial public engagement has taken place through the Public Participation Networks, Local Community Development Committees, LEADER Groups, Partnerships, sectoral interest groups, Rural Development companies and the Irish Local Development Network. From August 2016 onwards our Community Water Officers will actively engage with the public on areas connected with water management both locally and in the wider catchments. The success of community led projects such as those run by IRD Duhallow LIFE are good examples of a bottom up approach to local governance. By looking at the experiences of the Rivers Trusts across Ireland and the UK, and also Rural Development Companies, we can see the benefits of community stewardship in relation to water management. For this catchment based approach to be successful it will require all stakeholders including Local Authorities, Public Authorities, Non- Government Organisations and Communities to cooperate and work together for common goals. Funding will be critical if communities are to be mobilised and empowered to take on a greater role in the management of their local water environment. To this end, our office will offer technical advice and assistance to local authorities, community and voluntary groups on local, regional, national and EU funding streams with a connection to water management. Community engagement will require education and awareness campaigns to deliver the right message to the right groups in the right way. Results and lessons learnt from projects and initiatives with a connection to water can be shared widely on social media platforms, thereby facilitating knowledge and information transfer between communities. This innovative approach to integrated catchment management has never been attempted on this scale anywhere in Europe. For this to work we must see all our influences on our natural waters as part of a bigger picture in the wider catchment sense and work together to manage them. This should result in improved water quality and the associated benefits that go with it. Finally, a quote from the Water Framework Directive: â€˜water is not a commercial product like any other but rather, a heritage which must be protected, defended and treated as suchâ€™.

Cork. This workshop explored the potential role of Rural Development Companies and Urban Partnerships in water management, and how we can work together to manage our community water resources into the future. The new LEADER programme offers exciting opportunities for the development of local economies in both the rural and urban environments, underpinned by good management of water and its related biodiversity. How to do this in an effective manner is a challenge for each community group as this is an evolving area which requires specialist expertise. Local field trip to look at results of Duhallow LIFE project The workshop included knowledge exchange via the LIFE+ WaterLIFE project ( waterlife.org.uk ) and the Catchment Based Approach ( www. catchmentbasedapproach.org ) two closely aligned initiatives to drive collaborative water management in the UK. By looking at the UK and Irish experience in community based water management, the workshop took a practical look at how to develop water based projects, considering the issues to watch out for and how community groups can maximize the water potential of their local areas. Improved water quality and habitats underpin water based ecotourism and communities also depend on these for a good quality of life. The workshop contained a mixture of practical examples and highlighted potential roadblocks to good projects, ideas for project development were illustrated and how these fit into the bigger of picture of better water management. The overall objective was to explore and demonstrate ways in which Rural Development Companies can become more that just funders by taking proactive roles in strategic planning, animation of and coordinators of stakeholders with an interest in sustainable water management in Ireland. In addition Rural Development Companies and Partnerships are well positioned to leverage other schemes (Rural Social Scheme/ TÃºs) to carry out large scale programmes such as invasive species control. This two day event showcased how this can be done based on proven and practical approaches from both Ireland and the United Kingdom.

A multi-disciplinary group of researchers at University College Dublin (UCD), University College Cork (UCC) and the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG) investigated the relationships between conifer forests, forestry operations, and surface water quality and ecology in Irish rivers and lakes. The report is available on the EPA website . EPA-funded research generates a scientific base to support environmental protection. Projects are carefully targeted to deliver on three key areas: Identifying pressures; Informing policy and Developing solutions. Identifying Pressures Implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires identification and quantification of anthropogenic pressures on water resources and the implementation of Programmes of Measures (POMs) to prevent further deterioration in water quality and achieve least good status for all waters. The 2005 â€œNational Characterisation Report for Irelandâ€� produced during the first WFD management cycle, identified forestry as one of the land-use activities posing potential risk in terms of diffuse pollution due to increased acidification from conifer plantations in acid-sensitive catchments, sedimentation from clear felling, harvesting, new plantations, road construction and erosion on steep catchments, and eutrophication from fertilisation on steep catchments and forest harvesting on peat soils. The Hydrofor project identified windrowing as an additional potential source of sediment and nutrients in streams. The potential for impact depends on the magnitude of the pressure and susceptibility of the pathway as well as the sensitivity of the receptor. Informing Policy The research presented in this report will inform forest policy review, environmental considerations in the development of forestry programmes, the refinement of forest and water quality guidelines, and guidance on best practice in relation to forest operations aimed at reducing pollutant inputs. The latter is especially relevant in the development of measures to protect endangered species such as the pearl mussel. The research also has relevance to water quality monitoring and reporting by the Environmental Protection Agency and overall land-use planning. Developing Solutions HYDROFOR addressed several key information needs by investigating pollutant inputs from forest operations through the entire forest cycle. The key drivers of the episodic acidity were shown to be organic acidity together with base cation dilution. Higher losses of organic acidity from forests planted on peat were highlighted as a concern. Elevated sediment and phosphorus release to water courses was detected during felling, windrowing and replanting. A small number of potential mitigation measures (aquatic buffer zones and sediment traps) to address these problems were investigated in this study and the research evidence highlighted their ability to reduce some pollutant inputs.

There is significant pressure to develop knowledge exchange processes that will facilitate the application of existing and new knowledge in order to deliver increased agricultural production efficiency and profitability, while protecting natural capital including water. The report is available on the EPA website . EPA-funded research generates a scientific base to support environmental protection. Projects like AgImpact are carefully targeted to deliver on three key areas: Identifying pressures; Informing policy and Developing solutions. Identifying Pressures There is significant pressure to develop knowledge exchange processes that will facilitate the application of existing and new knowledge in order to deliver increased agricultural production efficiency and profitability while protecting natural capital including water. During the AgImpact workshops the participants identified that key pressures on knowledge exchange processes are the variability in the bio-physical environment in which production agriculture occurs, and variability in the socioeconomic and demographic profiles of those involved in implementing the knowledge. It was clear from the workshop discussions that the ever increasing knowledge base, its complexity and its often â€œcompartmentalisedâ€� nature further adds to the pressure. In addition the project identified that at policy level, conflicting goals and agendas has led to a level of uncertainty that increases the pressure on stakeholders in applying knowledge. Informing Policy The growth in the agri-food industry, as envisioned in Food Wise 2025 and Northern Irelandâ€™s Going for Growth strategic plan, must be achieved within the context of the targets established within European Union environmental directives, such as the Nitrates (91/676/EEC) and Water Framework Directives (2000/60/EC). The project workshop participants identified that the increased complexity of the agri-food system, with multiple economic, environmental and social policy objectives in addition to a broader range of stakeholders, requires on-going innovation to ensure a KE framework that reflects this new order. It was agreed that at policy level there was a need for a common vision for how sustainable intensification of agriculture could be achieved within the constraints of current environmental regulation. Developing Solutions The key recommendation from this project is the need to change from the traditional topdown linear knowledge transfer model of KE to a more balanced system that integrates both a bottom up and a top down approach. A suggested approach to achieving this integration was the establishment of a grant scheme that could be used to initiate a catchment competition. This scheme would focus on providing community stakeholders with funding and resources to integrate a bottom up approach to KE into exiting top-down structures within their catchment.

Those who live near the Suir have immediate access to a wonderful resource and there are many who regularly access the river for lifestyle and recreational purposes. Tipperary County Council engaged with these communities through two INTERREG co-funded projects, each of which had a focus on waterways. One of these projects was Green and Blue Futures: The social economy and the management of green infrastructure. This project aimed to establish a transnational European framework to mobilise the voluntary sector in the management of green infrastructure such as nature sites, parks, woodlands and waterways. It brought together seven partners from five jurisdictions across Northwest Europe: Scottish Waterways Trust and Scottish Canals (Scotland), The Canals and Rivers Trust (England), Tipperary Co Co (Ireland), RÃ©ussir en Sambre Avesnois (France) and Province du Hainaut and West Flanders (Belgium). The partners looked at ways to combine social objectives, such as tackling unemployment and engaging disconnected youth, with environmental activities like protecting riverbanks, controlling invasive species and the productive use of green urban spaces. Social enterprise models were explored which combine a focus on positive social outcomes with a business model to generate income in order to move away from a reliance on grant funding. The project allowed staff from a broad range of sections within the local authority to work together on a project focused on the Suir and the communities and individuals connected to it. A 56 km stretch of the river from Cahir to Carrick on Suir was chosen to focus efforts and resources given that the timeframe was July 2012 to September 2015. The local authority had already identified the various communities and individuals connected with the Suir from a previous INTERREG project called Waterways Forward, examples of these groups are: Ardfinnan and Clonmel Canoe Clubs; Kilsheelan and Golden Tidy Towns Committees; and Cahir and Carrick on Suir River Rescue teams. As a result, a strong network of communities emerged along the river corridor and the project provided opportunities for regular communication and knowledge sharing. Examples of project activities undertaken are: A surveying and mapping initiative which focused on existing access and egress points along the river between Cahir and Carick on Suir. Meetings held in council chambers provided opportunity for conversation and discussion about the river and the existing activities. Local knowledge identified 41 existing access locations which were then surveyed from both land and the river. The results of this were then presented back to the communities. A local authority led, but community driven, design process for improving river access points at locations used for canoeing/ kayaking, angling and triathlon events. Up to 80 people from the local communities engaged with this aspect of the project. A â€˜Youth Connectâ€™ project, which attracted 45 young people, delivered education on biodiversity and training on skills such as fly-fishing, stonework, kayaking and photography. Restoration of river banks using natural material such as stone, clay and willow was undertaken by the Kilsheelan Tidy Towns Committee with support from a local employment scheme. An overgrown area adjacent to an abandoned septic tank was transformed into a riverside â€˜Garden of Renewalâ€™ with seating, natural stone features and planting of native trees and shrubs. An art project with a river theme had installations along the river towpath at Kilsheelan reflecting local heritage and stories. This involved 182 participants and created a 2.5km art trail along the river and received 150 visitors over a single weekend. An international conference was held in Clonmel in Oct. 2013, the theme was â€˜Developing the socio-economic potential of waterwaysâ€™. One of the speakers Tony Harvey, Head of Enterprise, Canals and Rivers Trust UK was so taken by the natural beauty of the Suir that he spent the first two minutes of his presentation waxing lyrical about an Otter he had seen climb the river bank with a fish in its mouth. This conference saw two hundred speakers and delegates discuss a broad range of topics from the protection of biodiversity and habitats to the development of recreational activities and tourism connected with waterways. The final outcomes of the project, particularly around the cost-effective management of green & blue infrastructure, will aim to inform European policy in the area of natural resource management and the structuring of future funding programmes. In Tipperary the Green and Blue Futures project brought about a new focus on the River Suir for both the Local Authority and the communities. The river had been viewed negatively in the past by many due to regular flooding, however flood relief schemes in the main towns and villages have acted to address this and now the focus is on more positive associations with the river. Increased activity and involvement along the river is evident today and this has resulted in more community ownership of planned future developments. For example, the development of a River Suir Blueway trail could provide a range of walking, cycling and paddling activities for local communities and visitors to the area. To compliment this a canoe/kayak activity hub in Clonmel is being driven by the local Canoe Club. Social enterprise models are being examined to provide some of the services required to establish this trail, such as canoe hire and cafÃ©s. One thing is for certain, this project provided an opportunity to develop a new working arrangement and partnership between the local authority and local communities. The overarching vision has been to restore peopleâ€™s sense of place and connection with the river, to increase biodiversity by having more life in and along the river and to utilise this natural resource to promote recreational activity and economic development. The newly established Local Authority Waters and Communities Office aims to build on positive experiences such as this throughout the entire country, and would like to hear about any similar initiatives or ventures connected with our natural waters.

How healthy is the Suir Catchment? August 12, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , News Do we have the balance right between living and working in, and maintaining a healthy Suir catchment, and if not, what do we need to do to redress the situation? The Suir catchment is 3500 km2 in size, rising on the Devilâ€™s Bit Mountain and flowing out to the sea at Waterford Harbour. The population in the catchment is approximately 200,000 spread across several major urban centres, including Thurles, Tipperary, Cashel, Clonmel and Waterford, and the rural population. Much of the catchment is freely draining with good farm land. Farming is consequently relatively intense in some areas. The density of domestic waste water treatment systems (septic tanks) is approximately 8 per km2. There are forestry operations in the upland areas of the Galtees and the Comeraghs, and peat extraction in the lowland areas east and northeast of Thurles. There are also mines, quarries, industrial activities and wind farms. However despite this high level of human activity in the catchment, there are also significant nature conservation values and places where biodiversity is known to be relatively high. For example, the River Suir is a known salmonid fishery. The catchment also contains 3 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated under the Habitats Directive to help protect rare animal and plant species, and a Special Protection Area (SPA) designated under the Birds Directive. There is even a small freshwater pearl mussel subcatchment that flows into the Suir downstream of Waterford. So the catchment supports a wide range of livelihoods and ecosystem services, but how are the catchmentâ€™s aquatic ecosystems coping with all these activities? Do we have the balance right between living and working in, and maintaining a healthy Suir catchment, and if not, what do we need to do to redress the situation? This question is central to the Water Framework Directive river basin management planning process. Plans are made every 6 years containing actions to enhance and protect water quality and the ecosystems that depend on it. We are currently in the characterisation stage of the 2nd planning cycle which is due to culminate in our 2nd cycle plans being completed at the end of 2017, and implemented between 2018 and 2021. Characterisation of water bodies is a critical element of the work required under the Water Framework Directive, and is about understanding how our catchments work and how human activities impact on water, in order to prioritise appropriate actions that ensure that we do get that balance right. In this 2nd cycle our philosophy is about looking for â€˜the right measure in the right placeâ€™ to achieve the best outcome, which will build on the â€˜one size fits allâ€™ approach of the last cycle. The EPA, with the assistance of RPS consultants, the local authorities and the Inland Fisheries Ireland officers, are currently working through characterising all of Irelandâ€™s streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries, coasts and groundwaters, one by one, to determine what and where the water quality issues are, what are the significant pressures causing those issues, and what can be done about them. All the information is being recorded in a new EPA water management system, known as the Water Framework Directive Application, which is being made available on this website. So what did we find in the Suir catchment? In general aquatic ecosystem health in the Suir catchment is fairly good. The majority of surface water bodies were â€œNot at Riskâ€� i.e. are expected to meet their Water Framework Directive objectives, meaning that no further actions are required in addition to the basic requirements of the current regulations and best practice management. Water quality trends are also generally improving across the catchment although there are some key hotspot areas where problems continue to arise. 64 (35%) surface water bodies, including the Suir estuary and 4 small groundwater bodies, were found to be At Risk and will require specific measures to achieve improved water quality outcomes. The vast majority of the water bodies containing the protected areas had also already met their objectives. The most significant water quality issue is excess phosphorus (P) from a variety of sources including human and animal wastes and fertilisers, leading to eutrophication, which is impacting on rivers, lakes and estuaries. Groundwater provides a significant pathway for delivery of phosphorus to surface waters in some places, and is impacted by industrial sites and a landfill in the four small key areas. Poor habitat quality and excess sediment from peat extraction, forestry and channel maintenance, as well as excess ammonium from the worked peat, are also important issues in specific areas. The most widespread significant pressure in the Suir catchment, in terms of numbers of water bodies impacted, is agriculture. Agriculture is also probably one of the most challenging pressures because it is widespread, and the sources of pollution sources are diffuse, for example from fertilisers or pesticides being spread, and from faeces and urine from livestock in fields, as well as small point sources, all of which can be difficult to manage. The next step is to use the range of tools now available to us, which are described in other articles on this website, to help pin down exactly where and what the issues are in the problem areas we have highlighted and identify precisely what needs to be done to resolve them. We know from catchment and estuary modelling that if we can reduce the losses of P from a relatively small number of river water bodies, this should also be enough to bring the P reaching the estuary back to levels that would support Good status. Twenty investigative assessments have been targeted for the relevant local authorities to prioritise. These will be carried out using the pollution impact potential maps to help focus the effort. Weâ€™ll be adding more posts to the website to explain each of these concepts. The specific problems that are identified will be rectified using a mix of engagement, accessing voluntary incentive schemes and enforcement of existing regulations. In addition, Irish Water plan to deliver structural improvements to two waste water treatment plants within the Suir catchment by 2021, and a further five by 2027, which will have positive impacts for water quality overall. A collaborative, focussed effort will be needed to tackle the significant pressures identified in the Suir catchment. It will need to involve multiple agencies, including staff from the new Waters and Communities office, and the local landholders. Such a collaborative approach will be essential to achieve that balance that will sustain a productive, yet healthy, Suir catchment for the long term.

Can the Suir estuary function as a â€˜canaryâ€™ for itâ€™s catchment? The Suir and associated rivers join up to create one of the largest estuarine systems in Ireland. The tidal limits extend up the Three Sisters to Carrick on Suir on the Suir river, Saint Mullins on the Barrow, and Inishtioge on the Nore. The main channels of the Suir and the Barrow-Nore system converge at Cheekpoint and continue towards the sea past the Passage East ferry, Dunmore East, and finally at Hook Head out into the Celtic sea. Given the importance of this estuary at a local scale and to the larger marine environment, the EPA, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Marine Institute undertake monitoring of water quality and ecology from the mouth of Waterford harbour up to the tidal limits and beyond. This information allows us to get a holistic picture of the general ecology of the estuarine area, but also allows us to use the estuary as an indicator of what things are like upstream. #gallery-2 { margin: auto; } #gallery-2 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 100%; } #gallery-2 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-2 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */ The shore at Hook Head where the combined inputs of the three large estuaries join the open coastal waters Photo: Robert Wilkes Sampling from the EPA hovercraft Photo: Robert Wilkes EPA Hovercraft: used for sampling in otherwise inaccessible estuaries Photo: Robert Wilkes The Dunbrody on the Nore at New Ross Photo: Robert Wilkes Suir Estuary, the largest of The Three Sisters, at Waterford City Photo: Robert Wilkes Estuaries as indicators In many freshwater systems, the nutrient that is of most concern for its effects on the biological communities is phosphorus (P). Measures have been in place to reduce loading of phosphorus into our catchments and these have proved quite effective, with inputs of phosphorus from the Three Sisters into the Suir Estuary decreasing by 60 % since 2000, and concentrations of this nutrient in the estuary are now considered to be acceptable. As less emphasis is placed on nitrogen (N) reduction this nutrient has only shown a 15 % decrease in the same time frame. Not surprisingly, this nutrient is above the levels which are acceptable for Irish estuarine systems. This has resulted in more of the nitrogen in the catchment being available for plant growth. While this is not immediately obvious in the upstream freshwater areas, once this nitrogen reaches the estuary biological effects can be observed. As the ultimate receptors of all the inputs upstream, the estuarine and coastal areas can tell us a lot about what is happening in the overall catchment. We can use the biological communities to tell us about nutrients in the water, or chemical pollutants. Useful indicators to look at nutrient pressures are the seaweeds. We use the presence and abundance of certain seaweeds, such as sea lettuce, to tell us about the nutrient conditions in the estuary. In areas where nitrogen inputs increase these green seaweeds can grow in huge quantities causing an environmental impact. Other indicators of nutrient pressures are the phytoplankton communities (small plants that grow suspended in the water column) which can change depending on the balance of nutrients coming downstream. In severe cases this can result in large harmful algal blooms that can affect the other marine communities, such as shellfish or the bottom dwelling animals. In the Suir we have seen some disturbances to the marine plants with elevated levels of phytoplankton in the water suggesting that the nutrient conditions are too high. We can use this information, along with the other data from our monitoring programmes, to work out what has to be done to improve the situation. By looking at the estuary and coastal areas we can develop an idea of the sort of changes that need to take place in the whole catchment for improvement across all our waters.

The River Suir drains a catchment of 3,542kmÂ². The headwaters of the Suir are located on the northern flanks of the Devilâ€™s Bit Mountain in Co. Tipperary. The river flows east and then south through a wide limestone plain, past Thurles, where the Suir is joined by the River Drish flowing off the coal bearing Slieveardagh Hills on the eastern edge of the plain, and the Tipperary Clodiagh, which drains the hills to the south and west of the Devilâ€™s Bit. The Suir continues southward towards Cashel where it is joined by the Multeen River from the west and onwards to Cahir before which the Fidaghta, Ard and Aherlow Rivers flow into the Suir from the Golden Vale on the northern side of the Galtee Mountains. To the south of Cahir, the Suir enters the east â€“ west aligned, limestone floored valleys which were formed by an ancient collision between the continental plates of Europe and America, and which characterise much of the landscape of southern Munster today. Here the Suir is joined by the Thonoge and Tar Rivers which drain the karstified valley between the Galtee and Knockmealdown mountains. The Suir then turns north near the village of Newcastle, meeting the Nier River which drains the western side of the Comeragh Mountains. The Suir then turns east before reaching Clonmel, after which it is joined by the River Anner, flowing from the north and draining much of the central part of the Suir catchment and the slopes of Slievenaman. The Suir becomes tidal just before reaching Carrick-on-Suir, and is joined by a number of rivers between this point and Waterford city including the Lingaun, Portlaw Clodiagh (the only designated Freshwater Pearl Mussel subcatchment in the Suir catchment), Pil, and Kilmacow Blackwater and then makes its way to the confluence with the Nore and Barrow Rivers east of Waterford City. The Suir estuary then turns south, flowing out to sea through Waterford Harbour between Dunmore East and Hook Head. #gallery-2 { margin: auto; } #gallery-2 .gallery-item { float: left; margin-top: 10px; text-align: center; width: 33%; } #gallery-2 img { border: 2px solid #cfcfcf; } #gallery-2 .gallery-caption { margin-left: 0; } /* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */ The Suir Headwaters Photo: John Lucey The Suir as it flows towards its estuary Photo: John Lucey A weir on the Suir Photo: John Lucey The Suir expanding n width as it flows through the catchment Photo: John Lucey River levels and river flows are measured on the Suir and its tributaries by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in conjunction with the Local Authorities for: drinking water supply resource assessment, waste water discharge assimilative capacity* calculations , environmental monitoring, conservation, and to enable planning and development proposals to be assessed. *â€™Assimilative capacityâ€™ refers to the ability of a body of water to cleanse itself; its capacity to receive waste waters or toxic substances without deleterious effects and without damage to aquatic life or humans who consume the water. The Office of Public Works also measures river levels and river flows in the catchment for drainage and flood management purposes. The hydrometric gauging station networks in the catchment are complimentary, with data shared between organisations to avoid duplication of effort. The EPA maintains the National Hydrometric Register and is a member of the National Hydrometric Working Group which provides national oversight of hydrometric operations to allow for efficient operation of hydrometric data collection. Due to the historical development of the networks, the Office of Public Works network is focused on the main channel of the Suir from Templemore in the north to Waterford City in the southeast, with a small number of stations located on larger tributaries including the Drish, Tipperary Clodiagh, Multeen, Aherlow, Nier, and Anner Rivers. As this network is focused on drainage and flood management, it contains a high proportion of stations that are only measuring river levels as opposed to river flows (i.e. the amount of water flowing in the river). There is an extensive flood risk in the Suir catchment, which is reflected in the number of hydrometric stations maintained by the OPW here. In total they maintain 19 river level only stations and 16 river flow stations in the catchment. The hydrometric stations maintained by the Local Authorities and the EPA conversely, are located where there is a need for river flow information relating to waste water discharge assimilation capacity, water resource assessment, environmental monitoring, and conservation objectives. Therefore, these stations tend to be located away from the main channel of the Suir at the location of waste water treatment or drinking water abstraction plants (Tipperary, Ballyporeen or Ballyshonnock for example), environmental sampling locations, or environmentally sensitive locations such as the Clodiagh Freshwater Pearl Mussel catchment at Portlaw. These types of assessments require river flow data which means this network is comprised exclusively of stations that measure river flow and not simply river level only. The EPA/Local Authority hydrometric network in the Suir catchment consists of 14 river flow stations. None of these stations are located on the main channel of the Suir, which is already covered to an adequate level by the Office of Public Workâ€™s stations. Half of the EPA/Local Authority stations are located on tributaries of the Suir upstream of Carrick-on-Suir where there are specific abstraction or discharge pressures, and half of the EPA/Local Authority stations are located on rivers draining into the tidal estuarine part of the Suir, where the Office of Public Works does not maintain stations that measure river flow. The combined network of 30 river flow monitoring stations and 19 river level only monitoring stations is one of the highest densities of any catchment in the country and provides a sound base for river flow related decision making in the Suir catchment. The EPA is currently undertaking a national review of the hydrometric network based on current and future river flow information needs. This review is based on an assessment of the known and possible pressures on the river and technological developments in river flow measurement, together with an understanding of the resource requirement relating to the collection of hydrometric data. In future, the existing, long-term strategic hydrometric network will be supplemented by a wider investigative hydrometric programme, including short-term project hydrometric stations that will provide tactical assistance to facilitate integrated catchment management on the ground in a practical manner. Combined with foreseen national developments in hydrometric modelling and estimation methods and applications, this will provide accurate river flow information for the Suir and its tributaries to inform decision making and effective management of the Suir catchment for all its residents.

Whatâ€™s living in the Suir, how healthy are our rivers? August 17, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , News The various uses of rivers can involve conflicting interests and often such uses disrupt the ecology or health of the river. The fact that several of the more important beneficial uses of rivers such as drinking water abstraction, amenity uses like water sports, and waste water disposal are all dependent on biological processes is rarely appreciated. If a riverâ€™s natural self-purification process, for example, is disrupted by pollution or over- abstraction, some or all beneficial uses may be impaired or lost. It is important, therefore, to keep ecological disruption to a minimum and to maintain the aquatic ecosystem in a healthy, functional condition. Progress towards this goal can be assessed by chemical or biological means or, preferably, by a combination of both. In general it could be said that whilst physico-chemical monitoring may measure the causes of pollution i.e. the pollutants, biological monitoring is the only means whereby the ecological effects of pollution can be measured. What do we monitor? The EPA is responsible for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive monitoring programme, assessing the results and reporting on the quality of our waters at a national and European level. Biological monitoring of Irish rivers and streams was first undertaken in the 1970â€™s and since then has continued on a three year survey cycle. There are approximately 3,157 (2,831 biological and 1,463 chemical) monitoring sites on the national Water Framework Directive rivers monitoring programme. A total of 215 river sites are surveyed in the Suir catchment alone including 138 biological and 139 chemistry sites. Under the biological programme, the macroinvertebrate fauna (small animals without a backbone that can be seen with the naked eye) and the aquatic plants and algae residing in the river are examined, the species are identified, and their relative abundances are recorded. Using their known sensitivities and tolerances to pollution, biological indices can be applied to the observed data to summarise their ecological condition classifying the river site from satisfactory, that is High or Good condition, to unsatisfactory: Moderate, Poor or Bad conditions. Fish surveys are carried out as part of the WFD monitoring programme including the Suir catchment.

The fish, aquatic plant and algal communities are examined and assessed in more detail at a limited number of surveillance sites across the country. Macroinvertebrates play an important role in river ecosystems, as they feed on algae and microorganisms, break down organic matter, recycle nutrients, and are prey for fish, birds, mammals and other macroinvertebrates. The aquatic macroinvertebrates are seen as important biological indicators. Macroinvertebrates are relatively sedentary in nature, different species have life cycles spanning from one to three years. The macroinvertebrate community therefore while residing in the river bed substrata will demonstrate the effects of changing water quality conditions over time. Depending on the water chemistry composition, the river flow and available habitats, the aquatic macroinvertebrate fauna is usually represented by the larval forms and in some cases adult forms of various insect groups such as mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, damselflies, dragonflies, true flies, beetles, true bugs, and other groups such as snails, mussels, worms, leeches and crustacean shrimp and crayfish. Important protected macroinvertebrate species such as Austropotamobius pallipes (Lereboullet), the white clawed crayfish and to a lesser extent Margaritifera margaritifera L., the freshwater pearl mussel are known to occur in rivers across the Suir catchment. The EPA Q-Value System is based on the well-established sensitivities, abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates and their relation to water quality. The Q Value system has been used to assess the quality of Irish rivers since the 1970â€™s. It has a nine point scale ranging from Q5 indicating high quality to Q1 bad quality. The scheme mainly reflects the effects of organic pollution i.e. deoxygenation and eutrophication i.e. nutrient enrichment, but can also reflect the effects of toxic chemical pollution e.g. pesticides, and general habitat degradation. Biological macroinvertebrate surveys are usually undertaken in the most sensitive time of the year, summer to early autumn period, when flows are likely to be relatively low, water temperatures are higher and any stresses on aquatic ecosystems are expected to be at a maximum. Biological material for examination is obtained by kick-sampling, a method used to disturb the river bed substrate and dislodge the resident macroinvertebrates living in the shallower, faster-flowing areas (riffles) into a standard pond net. The sample is then transferred to a white tray and the assessment of water quality is completed on the river bank. What is ecological monitoring telling us? In 2014, 138 macroinvertebrate Q value surveys were carried out across the Suir catchment, the macroinvertebrate Q value results indicated that 88 of the 138 sites or 71% of the river channel length surveyed was at high or good (Q4 or greater) ecological condition while 50 sites indicated unsatisfactory ecological condition (less than Q4). This unfortunately represents a decline in quality on the 2010-2012 survey period when approximately 78% of the river channel length surveyed was considered to be at satisfactory ecological condition Suir River Ecology â€“ Water Framework Directive Q Values Once the macroinvertebrate Q value survey is completed, the results are provided by the EPA as online maps and published in Interim Reports on River Quality http://www.epa.ie/QValue/webusers/ . These results are then used in combination with other available information, for example chemical monitoring results and fish monitoring results, to assess the WFD ecological status for each of the countryâ€™s monitored river water bodies. The Q value survey results are the main source of information employed to highlight where an ecological impact from pollution or activities in the catchment is occurring on a river system. The results inform catchment managers of where the pressure is impacting, and where programmes of measures will need to be targeted in order for river quality to improve. The monitoring programme results also provide important updates to demonstrate when the implemented measures are working.

Managing our water so it can meet our current and future needs and also continue to support the ecosystems that depend on it is vital for Irelandâ€™s future. Effective management of water requires us to look at the pressures on our water resources at an appropriate scale â€“ large enough that we can take account of all the relevant information, but small enough to ensure that people who live in the area can easily relate to their catchment. Experience around the world and in Ireland has shown that an integrated approach to managing individual catchments of an appropriate scale is necessary to protect and improve water resources. A catchment is an area where water is collected by the natural landscape and flows from source through river, lakes and groundwater to the sea. Managing our catchments requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information â€“ how people are using the water, including drinking, agriculture, industrial use and bathing; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water bodies are connected both above and below ground, how the water flows from where it falls as rain to the sea; how people use the land and water bodies and what livelihoods are supported; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. Integrated catchment managementâ€”what does it involve? Gathering the best available information to understand the catchment â€“ where the water comes from, how it flows through the landscape both overground and underground, and what activities in the catchment may be causing pollution. Looking at all the uses of water â€“ drinking, agricultural, industrial and recreational, and also the vital ecosystems that depend on water to survive. Engaging local communities and involving them in decision making and management of their catchment. Adopting appropriate measures to ensure that activities that represent a significant threat to water resources are effectively managed. Applying the scientific and local knowledge of how the catchment operates to protect and improve water, providing a healthy, resilient, productive and valued resource that supports vibrant communities. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) Explained This piece of EU legislation has become a major driver for achieving sustainable management of water in Ireland and across the EU. Under this directive, all inland and coastal waters must reach â€˜Goodâ€™ ecological status. â€˜Good ecological statusâ€™ means achieving satisfactory quality water, maintaining ecosystems that can support all the species of plants, birds, fish and animals that live in these aquatic habitats. A key part of the Water Framework Directive is Article 14, which requires all member states to genuinely engage with the people who live, work and play in a catchment. To do this, it is important to understand how local communities live in their catchments and use their water. Therefore, it is critical that local communities are involved in management and decision making related to protecting and, where necessary, improving their water resources. Ultimately, meeting the sometimes narrow objectives of the WFD is not the aim â€“ helping communities protect and improve a beautiful and diverse landscape with accessible healthy waterways that are productively used to support livelihoods, habitats and rich wildlife is the goal. However, the WFD is a powerful tool to help in achieving this goal. Working Together â€“ The EPAâ€™s role in Integrated Catchment Management The EPAâ€™s Catchment Science and Management Unit will work together with local authorities, other public authorities, government agencies, and local communities in establishing effective integrated catchment management in Ireland. The main purpose of the Unit is to protect and improve water resources, while ensuring that any water body remains productive for the communities that depend on it. A key focus of our work will be integrating existing knowledge from a range of disciplines â€“ including hydrology, hydrogeology, ecology and hydrochemistry â€“ with data on the pressures that are impacting on water bodies in our catchments from sources such as urban waste water treatment, septic tanks, farming, forestry and landfills. Integration of this data will provide us with an understanding of how pressures and geology are linked, enabling us to develop effective plans and measures to improve water resources that are both economically and environmentally sound. To do this, we will be undertaking WFD Characterisation, delivering a template River Basin Management Plan, and engaging with stakeholders. The Characterisation Approach and River Basin Management Plans Nationally, we are required to deliver the 2 nd Cycle River Basin Management Plan in 2017. To do this, we must first characterise our water bodies. This allows us to then to develop mitigation measures targeted at restoring and protecting our water bodies that are at risk of not reaching good status. There are three steps in the characterisation process: Preliminary Risk Screening : a risk assessment of the status of water bodies, trends and the distance to thresholds based on monitoring data. This screening identifies water bodies â€˜At Riskâ€™ of not achieving good WFD status. Initial Characterisation : allows the â€˜At Riskâ€™ water bodies to be further investigated at a subcatchment scale (100-250 km 2 ) and catchment scale. At this stage EPA will work with local authorities to determine which pollution sources have the greatest impact on water bodies by identifying likely significant pressures such as point sources and critical source areas for diffuse pollution. Further Characterisation : is targeted at the significant pressures, such as critical source areas for example, and involves undertaking investigative assessment such as catchment walks and monitoring to get an understanding of how these sources of pollution can be reduced or managed more effectively. The characterisation process informs the selection of the programme of measures. The involvement and cooperation of local communities, local authorities, and government/public bodies will be essential to ensure that the measures implemented are successful in improving our water resources.

EPA-funded research generates a scientific base to support environmental protection. Projects are carefully targeted to deliver on three key areas: Identifying pressures; Informing policy and Developing solutions. Identifying Pressures The use of the Irish marine space is increasing. As maritime activities intensify, there is increased competition for use of space and potential conflicts with other objectives such as the protection of the marine environment. Addressing governance issues and resolving conflicts between different stakeholders are increasingly important. There is a need for a holistic vision and management to allow for the balance of social, economic and environmental interests and to ensure that maritime space and resources are used in a planned and sustainable manner. This report outlines a holistic vision and management to allow for the balance of social, economic and environmental interests and to ensure that maritime space and resources are used in a planned and sustainable manner. Informing Policy Maritime spatial planning (MSP) is a process by which state authorities analyse and organise human activities in marine areas to achieve ecological, economic and social objectives. It is the subject to the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (2014/EC/89). The Directive has to be transposed by September 2016 and maritime spatial plans have to be in place by April 2021. There is a need adopt a coherent approach to the preparation of maritime spatial plans in an Irish context. The research outlined in this report will support policy implementation in this important area. Developing Solutions This research project seeks to develop a staged integrated approach for the preparation of maritime spatial plans in Ireland which will facilitate the management of maritime area in a sustainable manner. The staged approach ensures that a rational and consistent process is applied to the spatial plan-making processes. This approach facilitates a full understanding of the maritime environment and issues, allows for appropriate objective-setting and strategy development, provides a framework for drafting the plan and resolving conflicts, and allows for adoption and monitoring. As spatial planning is an on-going process within plan-making cycles, there is a review process which allows for revision and updating. Integration of plan-making, environmental assessment and consultation promotes broader acceptance by stakeholders, ensures a legally robust plan and effectively integrates environmental considerations and the ecosystem-based approach into plan preparation.

The Regulations also provide for the establishment of a Water Framework Directive Office (WFD Office) to deliver on these obligations as a shared service on behalf of all Local Authorities. Kilkenny County Council and Tipperary County Council have been appointed as the lead Authorities for this project and will take responsibility for the WFD Office. This shared service arrangement will take account of the need to deliver maximum benefit with limited resource availability. The WFD Office will ensure that the resources are utilised locally within an integrated national WFD implementation plan, based on a single River Basin District. The strategic role of the Office will be: To promote knowledge sharing and coordination in implementing the River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) and the Programme of Measures (PoMs) by local authorities, other public authorities, sectoral interests and community groups. To coordinate/undertake statutorily required public consultation in development of the RBMPs and POMs and a public awareness campaign in water resources management. To seek consistency of RBMP implementation across agencies. To assist the Minister and the EPA and work collaboratively with local authorities in the development of RBMPs and POMs. To mobilise and support engagement of voluntary and community groups in protecting our natural waters. To foster linkages with industry and agricultural sectors. To develop linkages with local sectoral representative organisations such as Chambers of Commerce, county level IFA, angling groups, tidy towns etc. While the Office will be managed by Kilkenny County Council and Tipperary County Council, the greater portion of the staff will be placed throughout the country to ensure that resources can be harnessed and utilised locally. The staff complement will be: Three Regional Coordinators , who will work with LAs in developing annual implementation plans and coordinating the implementation of those plans. They will also establish linkages with national and regional groupings, develop and manage a public participation programme and work collaboratively with other stakeholders and seek opportunities for joint actions. Three Water Framework Directive Support Officers who will provide key services that cannot be provided due to the technical expertise required. Specifically the needs identified are expertise in accessing funding and managing funding requests, data management including spatial analysis of information and the provision of regional and national level input to characterisation and plan development activities and expertise in marketing, communications, education and public relations. Twelve Community Water Officers whose primary role will be to engage with communities and individual sectors of society at local level. They will be geographically spread throughout the country and will be based within twelve Local Authority centres. They will engage with the public in water matters, seeking participation, education, local inclusion, two way communications, understanding, trust, and developing local area water management plans in partnership with stakeholders to meet WFD RBMP objectives. www.watersandcommunities.ie Article by Matt Shorrt, Tipperary County Council, and Carol McCarthy, Kilkenny County Council Community Water Officer Locations Related Posts The development of Rivers Trusts in Ireland Rivers trusts are charities, established by local people to lookâ€¦ The Water Policy Advisory Committee: joined-up policy-making and the Water Framework Directive In 2014, the Minister for the Environment introduced the Europeanâ€¦ About author EPA Catchments Unit Administrator The EPA Catchments Unit is based in Dublin, and the team is involved with catchment science, chemistry, ecology, hydromorphology, modelling, Geographic Information Systems and planning.

Hydromorphology: What is it? July 26, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , News Hydromorphology considers the physical character and water content of water bodies. Good hydromorphological conditions support aquatic ecosystems (i.e. hydromorphological elements such as water flow and substrate provide physical habitat for biota such as fish, invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes). While hydromorphological impacts are not as severe compared to other European countries, it is an area that requires more attention in Ireland. As the second cycle of the Water Framework Directive approaches, an assessment is needed to identify hydromorphological pressures impacting Irish water bodies. Pressures can include abstraction, impoundment (i.e. dams and weirs), channelisation and embankments. My main role in the EPA Catchment Science and Management unit is to help develop a hydromorphological risk assessment approach for rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal water bodies. The EPA approach to hydromorphological risk assessment The risk assessment is a three stage approach with each stage screening water bodies in order to prioritise further investigation at the final stage. Preliminary Risk Screening: this will incorporate information on water bodies with known hydromorphological issues based on expert opinion, along with evaluating national monitoring data in order to identify any indications of other pressures other than eutrophication. This will help identify water quality issues that need to be addressed first; it is vital to tackle water quality pressures prior to implementing hydromorphological measures. These water bodies, along with water bodies with known impacts caused by hydromorphological pressures, will be given high priority for the next stage. Initial Hydromorphological Characterisation: this will involve a GIS based desktop assessment to identify the screened water bodies that may be impacted by various hydromorphological pressures. Further hydromorphological characterisation: this can include actions such as field assessments to finally assign a risk category to the water body. This will allow the identification of appropriate mitigation and rehabilitation measures. Screening water bodies throughout the process will allow for a streamlined focused approach. Hydromorphology â€“ Barriers to Connectivity In recent years, a lot of hydromorphological work has been carried out in Ireland. The OPW and IFIâ€™s Environmental River Enhancement Programme (EREP) is a good example of this work. Existing hydromorphological information, such as EREP, needs to be built into the risk assessment. In addition, the approach will lead the way to building a comprehensive, standardised national hydromorphological dataset for future work. Worldwide, there is still a poor understanding of the quantitative links between hydromorphological degradation and ecological response. As eco-hydromorphology is constantly evolving, the approach will be reviewed as the science develops further.

Integrated Catchment Management is a community-led approach that aims to involve people and groups from across society. 46 Catchments 583 Subcatchments 4829 Waterbodies View Data and Dashboards What is a catchment, and why should you care? All of us live in catchments, whether it is the catchment area for a school or hospital, or a catchment area for a local stream, river, lake or coastal water. For water, a catchment is simply defined as an area of land contributing to a river, lake or other waterbody. We all want to have good quality schools and hospitals in our community, as this can help with enhancing education and health, and overall quality of life. In the same way, living in a catchment that has healthy water can help a community have a better quality of life â€“ the water can help make sure local people have high quality drinking water, support livelihoods like agriculture, recreational angling or water sports, and support local ecosystems, so plants, animals, fish and insects that depend on having healthy water can thrive and flourish. Find out more Using data to help understand our catchments Managing our catchments effectively requires us to understand and integrate a huge range of information. This includes: how people use the land and waterbodies, and what livelihoods are supported; the geography and geology of an area, looking at how all the water flows both above and below ground from where it falls as rain to the sea; and possible sources of pollution, including urban waste water treatment plants, septic tanks, and runoff from farming, forestry and landfills. You can see lots of this information on the Maps and Data pages, which will be added to over time. These pages show information about our 46 catchments, 583 subcatchments and 4829 waterbodies. Many waterbodies have charts available for trends in key biological and chemical indicators, which can help us understand how healthy they are, and the possible causes of any changes. Find out more How to get involved with your local catchment and make a difference today While understanding what is affecting our catchments and waterbodies can help us manage them, experience from projects in Ireland and around the world has shown that local community involvement is one of the keys to long-term success. There are many ways for individuals or local communities to get involved â€“ this can be anything from organising a Spring Clean of a riverbank once a year, getting your local Tidy Towns committee to look at how your river or lake can help your town become a nicer place to live, or even establishing a Rivers Trust or locally led agri-environment scheme to help draw down funding and establish a long term plan for your area.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News The Water Policy Advisory Committee: joined-up policy-making and the Water Framework Directive The Water Policy Advisory Committee: joined-up policy-making and the Water Framework Directive June 13, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Water Framework Directive In 2014, the Minister for the Environment introduced the European Union (Water Policy) Regulations 2014 which set out a new governance structure to achieve better implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Ireland. A number of reviews of the river basin management plans (RBMPs) produced under the first Water Framework Directive (WFD) cycle in Ireland concluded that implementation was fragmented. The 2014 Regulations therefore introduced a much more integrated governance structure where clear responsibilities were assigned to the EPA, the local authorities and the Minister. The Regulations also established the Water Policy Advisory Committee (WPAC) which brings together the key policy-setting national organisations that impact on Irelandâ€™s delivery of the WFD. The functions of WPAC are to advise the Minister on policy in relation to: the preparation of RBMPs; WFD environmental objectives; programmes of measures to achieve these objectives; and other related matters concerning the protection and management of the aquatic environment and water resources. The WPAC has been meeting on a quarterly basis since 2014 and it allows a range of Government Departments and agencies to consider the full range of policy measures, legislation and European Directives that potentially impact on WFD implementation in Ireland. It ensures that the 3 governance tiers set out in the 2014 Regulations align well. Those tiers are as follows: the Minister is ultimately responsible for the setting of environmental objectives, and for making programmes of measures and RBMPs; the EPA leads on the science that underlies WFD implementation, and it advises the Minister on the roles set out for him above; and local authorities are responsible for regional coordination, public consultation, and the implementation of RBMPs and programmes of measures in their functional areas. WPAC is chaired by a senior representative of the Minister, currently Ms. Maria Graham, Assistant Secretary, and the public bodies represented on WPAC are as follows: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; Department of Health; Environmental Protection Agency; County and City Management Association; Office of Public Works; Commissioners for Energy Regulation (who regulate public water and wastewater services); and Such other organisation or body as the Minister may determine from time to time. WPAC also invites external stakeholders to present to it and to discuss water management issues. Previous external invitees have included the Sustainable Water Network (SWAN) and Irish Water. In order to develop awareness of its work, reports of WPAC meetings are published on the Departmentâ€™s website (available at environ.ie ). In 2016, WPAC will focus on: the issues raised during the public consultation on significant water management issues in Ireland; the preparation of draft second cycle RBMPs by December 2016 (which will then be consulted on in 2017); and advising the Minister with regard to a regulatory regime for water abstraction. Successful implementation of the WFD can only be achieved by a whole-of-government, inter-agency and inter-sectoral approach. WPAC is an important forum for teasing out the interplay between the many issues which arise seeking to preserve and improve the quality of our inland, estuarine and coastal waters, and then to make appropriate recommendations to the Minister. While this cross-cutting approach takes more time than the traditional â€œtop-downâ€� directional approach to policy-making I firmly believe that it will ultimately produce better long-terms results.

Ten representative Irish WWTPs were audited in detail. The plants varied in scale, with regard to their design capacities, from 600 PE to 186,000 PE. Simultaneous energy and resource consumption and water quality audits were undertaken, resulting in the development of benchmarking tools and auditing methodologies, and the detailed performance evaluation of the plants to support better resource management and to provide baseline data with regard to the holistic performance of the WWTPs. The results of this research should be of interest to Irish Water and other water utilities, the EPA, WWTP managers, researchers, and policy makers amongst others. You can download the report from the EPA website . EPA-funded research generates a scientific base to support environmental protection. Projects are carefully targeted to deliver on three key areas: Identifying pressures; Informing policy and Developing solutions. Identifying Pressures Wastewater treatment is a resource intensive process utilising several inputs such as energy, chemicals and water to produce an effluent that meets designated environmental standards. Driven by environmental regulations, the focus of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has traditionally been the quality of the effluent and not necessarily energy or resource efficiency. Regulation and penalties incentivise the meeting of environmental effluent standards; however, to date, there are no such analogous penalties or incentives to expedite the focus on resource efficiency. It is imperative to recognise that resource utilisation and indeed sludge management also have significant environmental consequences, and therefore WWTP performance should be viewed holistically. Informing Policy The development of effective environmental wastewater treatment policies is dependent on a holistic understanding of the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment. Knowledge of these impacts in turn relies on accurate data to quantify the resources consumed to treat wastewater to the designated standards, and the impact of this broader consumption on the environment. Developing Solutions A suite of software tools to assist WWTP benchmarking and performance management was developed and tested: KPIAdvisor and KPICalc. The tools are easily accessible, highly automated, and suitable for implementation in WWTPs of varying treatment processes, population equivalent, staffing numbers and resource consumption. In addition, the toolkit can assist stakeholders in the identification of faults in data acquisition methods, offers users an incentive for improving data acquisition methods, and is flexible in terms of the frequency of data. Effective and efficient operation of WWTPs is best achieved at the design phase, when the longer term life cycle costs and performance of the WWTP are anticipated and optimised, rather than solely focusing on the initial capital costs. The key recommendations are as follows: Assess plant performance using multiple criteria and KPIs Specify and provide adequate monitoring, monitoring instrumentation and equipment Use energy efficient equipment Introduce and implement preventative maintenance schedules for plant process equipment, and ensure plant monitoring equipment is calibrated regularly Review plant power factors and control strategies regularly The EPA Research programme wishes to thank the following for their expert advice and input throughout the course of the project: Lisa Sheils and Dorothy Stewart (EPA), Mr John Gray (Consultant), Mr Thomas Griffin (DECLG), Dr Edmond Oâ€™Reilly (Irish Water), Mr Niall Durham and the various local authorities and wastewater treatment plant operators without whom this research would not have been possible.

Technical Note: Electrical Conductivity â€“ A useful tool for investigating catchment hydrology. August 30, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Plans and Guidance , Reports and Assessments , Research As environmental hydrology continues to grow in importance, both researchers and practitioners remain on the look-out for investigative techniques to help better understand where aquatic pollutants come from and how they reach water courses. Despite being routinely employed in some disciplines, Specific Electrical Conductance (SEC) remains a relatively underutilised tool for Irish hydrological investigations. This is unfortunate, as the method has been shown to provide a rapid and inexpensive, yet reliable means of measuring water quality in the field, provided certain constraints are taken into consideration. The following short article is the first of two presented in the Catchments Newsletter that examines the utility of SEC for Irish hydrological studies. Before undertaking SEC surveys, certain technical matters need to be considered to ensure that maximum benefit can be obtained from data collected. Readings are typically taken in the field using a handheld electrical conductivity meter, of which there are many brands on the market of contrasting quality and reliability. In general the maxim â€œyou get what you pay forâ€� applies, with those models at the upper end of the price range typically proving more resistant to instrument drift. However, regardless of what meter is employed, routine calibration is essential. This should typically be done at least once a day, using standards having SECs approaching those anticipated in a survey area; it is generally considered good practice to calibrate immediately before and immediately after a survey each day to ensure instrument reliability. Once the above precautions are considered, measurements in the field can provide a valuable insight into hydrological processes, particularly when data are collected in a catchment under contrasting hydrological regimes and/or at different times of the year. However, as electrical conductivity is temperature dependent, variations in how warm (or cold) different water samples are need to be accounted for; this is achieved by standardising all measurements to 25 degrees C to give Specific Electrical Conductance (SEC). Note that not all models of conductivity meter provide an SEC readout, under these circumstances temperature must be recorded and corrections to yield SEC retrospectively applied. Indeed, even where SEC is provided, it is generally considered good practice to measure temperature, as it can provide valuable supplemental information about hydrological processes, such as the location of upwelling groundwater. In the natural environment the SEC of water can vary enormously, from values around 5 microsiemens per cm (mS/cm) encountered in some rainwater samples, to levels one million times higher in saline waters. In unpolluted freshwater systems, SEC reflects the presence of substances present in the soils, subsoils and bedrock that water encounters along hydrological flow paths which form ions when dissolved. These can vary dramatically from one geological setting to another. For geological units typically encountered in Ireland, SECs can range from 10s of mS/cm in water samples collected from poorly decomposed raised bog peats to values over an order of magnitude higher in samples collected from units such as calcareous subsoils and carbonate bedrock. (Natural SECs above 1000mS/cm are rare in Irish freshwaters). F i gu r e 1: Box and Whisker plot of median specific electrical conductances for major Irish bedrock types, analysed as part of the EPAâ€™s groundwater monitoring programme. (Above) Limestone aquifers, (Below) Non-carbonate and mixed aquifer types. (Data provided by Anthony Mannix, EPA) Box and whisker plots contained in Figure 1 summarise the SEC of bedrock groundwater samples contained in the EPAâ€™s Groundwater Quality Monitoring Database. The plots provide an idea of anticipated ranges for each aquifer type and demonstrate more consistent median SECs in limestone aquifers, compared to non-carbonate and mixed aquifer types. The slightly lower median SEC and greater range of variation observed in non-carbonate aquifers partially reflects the influence of geochemistry. These aquifers are typically less reactive than limestones, giving lower SECs. However, their signature may be overprinted by carbonates present in the overburden, which then dominate ionic content in underlying aquifers, particularly in units with short residence times. In all aquifer types the range of variation remains relatively high. Given the level of variation observed, direct measurements of groundwater SEC in a catchment should be sought out to build confidence in interpreting catchment-specific data and the role of different hydrological flow paths At the catchment scale, where significant geochemical differences exist along various hydrological flow paths, SEC measurements can act as a useful screening tool for constraining potential processes. Mapping the results of these measurements across a catchment allows us to examine spatial variations in water quality and attribute responses observed to processes operating within subcatchments. Alternatively, use of automated SEC loggers permits large numbers of measurements to be collected in time at fixed points and thus provide a means of characterising (integrated) temporal variations in water quality (Figure 2). Figure 2: (Above) Multiple parameter plot illustrating the change in discharge, water temperature and SEC observed in river water at the outlet of the Glen Burn Test Catchment, Co. Down â€“February 2011. SEC helps discriminate between possible hydrological pathways. (Below) In Example (A) a rising water table results in increased higher SEC groundwater discharge (in green), while in Example (B) there is a dominance of lower SEC water (in pink) derived from shallower hydrological pathways. This latter case better corresponds to that observed at the Glen Burn (Data: P.Allen,QUB, 2011) SEC can also prove useful in detecting pollution, particularly where high concentrations of ions are present in source effluent, examples of which include landfill leachate, septic tank effluent and some agricultural wastes. In many cases the conductivities of these liquids prove significantly greater than background levels, thus permitting SEC to be employed as a screening tool for targeting samples for laboratory analyses. At the same time, examining trends in SEC levels along water courses allows us to identify potential sources of surface water pollution and the relative contributions they make to total pollutant load (See Figure 3 and Figure 4). Figure 3: Modelled examples of typical water quality profiles along a river reflecting responses to inputs of elevated SEC water under contrasting physical settings (right). A. Lower SEC stream (400 mS/cm) receiving sustained inputs of 700mS/cm water (1m3/ sec/100m). B. Input of 700mS/cm water (and doubling of discharge) between 900m and 100mm downstream. C. Response observed with an equivalent increase in SEC but with a flow increase of 0.1m3/sec over the same interval; the spike in the data (not simulated) reflects incomplete mixing of waters. While measuring SEC can prove a very valuable investigative tool, it is essential that data be interpreted while considering catchment land use and physical setting. Whatâ€™s more, there can often be considerable temptation to relate SEC to the concentration of specific pollutant concentrations. Although this may be appropriate, one needs to remember that not all ions (even at equivalent concentrations,) will generate the same SEC response. Consequently, SEC should be used, and compared to the results of laboratory based analyses to establish links (if any) with pollutant levels. As a corollary to this point, samples that do not have SECs differing significantly from pristine waters may still be polluted since many pollutants are not ionic and thus do not contribute to measured SEC responses. Furthermore, some pollutants, although ionic, may impact water quality at concentrations below levels that permit them to be confidently measured using field SEC meters. Finally, when interpreting results remember that profiling provides a snapshot of conditions and that water quality varies depending on hydrological processes operating at the time of measurement. Despite these limitations, SEC can prove a very useful investigative tool for environmental hydrologists. Maximum benefit can be obtained by combining its use with other routinely measured parameters, including with the results of laboratory water quality analyses, and with physical hydrological data. Moreover, repeated measurements of SEC in the same catchment, particularly during periods of contrasting hydrological conditions, build confidence in interpreting survey results. Although still relatively underutilised in Ireland, continuous monitoring of SEC with discharge during the recently completed EPA-funded Pathways Project demonstrated the value of the parameter for distinguishing between potential hydrological delivery mechanisms. SEC surveying deserves further consideration as an investigative technique in the Environmental Hydrologists tool kit. Experience to date across Ireland suggest that it can act as an useful method in helping identify pollution sources and characterising the pathways by contaminants can reach surface water receptors. This in turn can assist decision makers on taking suitable courses of action to maintain environmental quality.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News Duhallow LIFE: a community led water and nature conservation programme Duhallow LIFE: a community led water and nature conservation programme June 01, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Stories Sustainable management of water and wildlife often requires the cooperation of local people living within a catchment. Something not always appreciated, however, is that these communities themselves can also positively contribute towards better water management, if encouraged to take a proactive role in the management of their local water resource. Blackwater Freshwater Pearl Mussel There are a number of Irish examples of projects (e.g. Loobagh, Slaney and Mulkear Rivers) where local people are working on initiatives with others to improve their catchments. This article highlights some of the achievements of a community led EU LIFE funded project, which is focused on the upper reaches of the Munster Blackwater River, in north Cork and east Kerry. The Blackwater River is one of Irelands largest rivers, extending some 160km from source to sea and draining an area in excess of 3,000km2. The river rises in the mountains of east Co. Kerry, traversing much of Co. Cork and flowing into west Co. Waterford, before entering the sea at Youghal Bay. The river is one of Irelands most important tourist angling rivers and large numbers of anglers travel from the UK and further afield, to stay in local fishing lodges and soak up the beautiful scenery, taking time out from their busy lives to relax and fish. The river is also important for a range of wildlife and together with its tributaries is designated as a Special Area of Conservation. This designation is due to the presence of species of EU conservation importance such as otters, kingfishers, lampreys and salmon. The river is also the largest Special Area of Conservation designated under the EU Habitats Directive for the protection of the rare Freshwater Pearl Mussel in Ireland. Blackwater Atlantic Salmon (Photo duhallowlife.ie) Like so many other Irish rivers, a wide range of pressures have led to a decline in the rivers habitat and water quality. These pressures include changes in the landscape and water quality; forestry, intensification of agriculture, peat cutting, land reclamation, drainage, drinking water and waste water treatment, runoff from increasing road traffic, windfarm development, urbanisation, and septic tanks from rural one-off houses all present challenges to the management of the river. All these pressures are associated with most catchments in modern Ireland and so any conservation or management lessons learnt on the River Blackwater should be relevant for other catchments. In 2009 the Kanturk Angling Club, who had been carrying out river habitat improvement works, approached IRD Duhallow Ltd, the rural development company active in the area, and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board (now Inland Fisheries Ireland), with a view to develop a large scale project to improve the river for fish. They recognised the need for a broader holistic approach that took in all aspects of the biodiversity along the river, rather than focusing just on fish, and identified the EU LIFE funding mechanism as a possible source of funding. On consultation with ecologists and people with experience in funding applications, a pragmatic approach was taken, following a simple logic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ protect the most sensitive species, the Freshwater Pearl Mussel, and other species such as the Atlantic Salmon and Brown Trout would also benefit. Freshwater Pearl Mussel require pristine habitat and water quality and therefore any efforts to protect them should improve the environment for other coexisting species, including fish. Actions to protect other species such as Kingfisher, Dipper, and Otter were also added to the projects remit to further increase biodiversity improvements and importantly help increase engagement of the wider public. A team was put together and the completed application submitted. The project was awarded funding in 2010. From the beginning, the project took a peoplecentred view by including the community at its core. In tandem with ten on-the-ground conservation actions, another 19 actions covered project planning and communication with the public and key stakeholders at a range of levels. The project endeavoured to form partnerships with the local landowners, interest groups and state agencies to maximise the projects reach and achieve buy-in by all stakeholders. Regular meetings, public information nights, field trips, door-to-door calls, newsletters, brochures and information signage all went part and parcel with the project, so that that the local community and the wider stakeholder interest groups were kept informed. Much of the project work on the ground was carried out by participants on the Rural Social Scheme and volunteers. Conservation actions were carried out on a large scale, sometimes spanning the farms of hundreds of landowners. For example, the invasive species Himalayan balsam was removed from almost 40km of river bank. This was conducted annually over a five year period to the point that the plant, once found in very high densities along rivers in the River Allow catchment, is now virtually absent. This was achieved through the mobilisation of large groups of people and through a sustained effort by all involved. It followed a carefully planned strategy, which took into account the stages of development of the plant at different locations along the catchment. It was found that plants in open sunlight areas reached maturity earlier than those in shaded areas and therefore had to be targeted first, before dealing with the slower growing plants in wooded areas. Plants in sunlit areas were found to seed earlier than those growing in more shaded areas. But all the while, the project worked from the source of infestation in a downstream direction, as the seeds themselves are waterborne and can infest a large area downstream of a mature plant. This work was all done by hand, without the use of chemicals and is, as far as we are aware, the largest manual Himalayan balsam control programme of its type in Europe. Full credit to all involved, and despite their initial reservations, the participants, suspended their understandable reservations to go picking flowers and made the control programme a success. A number of innovations to address specific environmental problems were developed by the project. For example, farming along the catchment occurs within the floodplain, incidentally where some of the best cuts of silage are taken. However at certain locations due to repeated inundation by water during flood events, it was not practical for farmers to fence the river banks to manage their livestock. These floods carry debris, ranging from rushes to fully grown oak trees, down the river which in turn lodge and build up on the fences eventually breaking them. The inability to fence such areas left the river banks vulnerable to trampling and over-grazing by farm animals. Therefore the LIFE project team developed a novel technique with the local farmers to address this problem; fencing that could be placed along river banks and survive the onslaught of debris carried by regular flooding episodes. This innovation allowed farmers to maintain their fence line, ensuring that the 38km of fencing placed by the LIFE project will last over time, and can withstand the increasing floods that we are experiencing. Similarly, innovations were developed to trap silt travelling along deeply cut farm drains before it reached the Special Area of Conservation and smother the spawning beds of fish and Freshwater Pearl Mussel habitat. Blackwater Otter Photo: Duhallowlife.ie Willow planting techniques using live willow stakes and poles were tested, and a best practice river bank restoration technique was developed to address the more severe river bank erosion situations by working with nature. Thousands of native trees were planted along the river banks to improve tree diversity along the riparian areas and encourage increased root mass to bind the soil in the river banks and improve river bank stability during flooding episodes. All trees were sourced locally, following best practice with regards to provenance, being donated by local people and a Coillte locally managed native woodland estate. A continuous survey of Freshwater Pearl Mussel was carried out from the upper most point of occurrence all the way downstream to Kanturk town, a river length of over 28km. This is the longest continuous survey of Freshwater Pearl Mussel in the UK or Ireland. All of the records (over 14,000 individual mussels) were mapped on GIS and the data not only helped direct conservation works, but also identified areas affected by acute pollution. The latter was followed up and will be the subject of a separate article in a future issue of this newsletter. Actions were also carried out to improve the conservation status of Otters, Kingfishers and Dippers by the placement of nest boxes, Otter Holts and brush bundles. These actions not only improved available habitat for these species, but also increased local awareness as local farmers were engaged in discussions with the project team during the construction phase. Education was a major element of the project. Thirty-six national schools and five secondary schools were visited by the project team and these kids were then bussed to their local stream or river, all tributaries of the Blackwater, for a demonstration by Inland Fisheries Ireland staff on how fish are sampled by electrofishing. Demonstrations were also given on aquatic macroinvertebrates monitoring for the determination of water quality. In addition, the children took part in a fun Nature Detective programme, where they recorded wildlife in their back gardens and farms with their parents, logging their observations into attractive survey booklets provided by the LIFE project. The data was then uploaded onto an online map hosted on the project website. To increase public engagement, the project was actively promoted on social media. Updates and photographs from our trap cameras were regularly posted and one post of an Otter marking its territory received over 7,000 views, with hits from countries as far away as Mexico. A major part of the project is that it now serves as a demonstration project to illustrate what can be done to improve nature conservation by working with farmers at the practical level on the ground. The demonstration farms provide real world examples of how nature and farming can co-exist in relative harmony rather than in perpetual conflict. The ethos of IRD Duhallow, which aims to improve not only the economy of the rural area but also the social, cultural, heritage and environment of local people, means that the project will continue to evolve and improve, and hopefully not only deliver a positive impact to the local environment but also provide insights for those with interest in sustainable management and nature conservation in Ireland. The IRD DuhallowLIFE project ran from 2010 to 2015 and is now into its afterLIFE phase. This is the phase in which the partners commit to continue the work originally supported by the LIFE fund of the European Union. This project is the first community led EU LIFE Nature project in Ireland and has now been augmented by a second project, RaptorLIFE which is not only targeting conservation actions at other tributaries on the Blackwater SAC but also towards the upland landscape to improve habitat for fish and birds of prey. A major element of this work is the removal of invasive species such as Japanese knotweed, removal of invasive conifers and other non-native species, and working with upland farmers. Large scale projects, such as LIFE projects in themselves can deliver significant results on the ground, but they are also catalysts towards better environmental management, as it is only through the constant partnership working and evolution of ideas and solutions that the challenges of nature and water conservation and sustainable living can be achieved. So I imagine the afterLIFE phase of these projects will continue for some time to come and will need to be nurtured into the longer term to deliver their true potential.

An inland mountain range, they form the boundary between counties Carlow and Wexford. The highest peaks are Mount Leinster (796m), Blackstairs (734m) and Slievebawn (527m). The climate is drier and sunnier than the west of Ireland and so the principal habitat is Dry Heath, though Blanket Bog and Wet Heath occur along with Acid Grassland as vegetation mosaics. The upper slopes of the mountain range are unenclosed and are farmed as commonage. Typically sheep, mostly Cheviot, are put up between April and June when the lambs are strong enough. They are brought down in autumn and the lambs sold on as store lambs. A small number of farmers graze the commonage year round. This usually depends on how much green lowland fields farmers have to support stock in the winter. A small number of farmers have cows (sucklers) and horses on the commonage but the vast majority use sheep. The Blackstairs mountain range covers circa 70km2, of which 50.52km2 corresponding to the unenclosed land is designated a Special Area of Conservation. Dry and Wet Heath exist outside the Special Area of Conservation on enclosed land along with good examples of Semi-natural Grassland and Woodland and the area qualifies as being of high nature value due to the presence and quality of its peatland habitats. The mountains also have value as a cultural landscape containing archaeological sites dating back 5000 years including cursus monuments, summit cairns, a portal tomb and a cluster of rock art sites from the Neolithic period. The field systems adjacent to the commonage contain some particularly large granite drystone walls, up to 2.5m high and 4m wide in places and artefacts linked to traditional farming practices. â€œYou have to be born into hill farming and have a genuine interest in itâ€� The economic viability of farming in The Blackstairs has been in decline for decades. It became clear that the future of hill farming and hill farming communities was precarious and a small group of people began to ask what could be done. In April 2014, funding for pilot locally led projects using a similar approach to the Burren LIFE project was included in the Irish Rural Development Programme 2014-2020. Contact was made with Dr Brendan Dunford (Burren LIFE) and Dr James Moran (IT Sligo) and on their advice the Blackstairs Farming Group was formed. A diverse group, there were many motivations for involvement, the predominant one being a desire for farming and farming communities in the Blackstairs to move from slow incessant decline to a more sustainable footing. There was also a shared connection to the land, to the Blackstairs and a desire for the skills and knowledge acquired by Blackstairs farmers over generations to be recognised, valued and sustained. Blackstairs Landscape Photo: Fergal Murphy â€œYou donâ€™t learn anything about hill farming in agricultural collegeâ€� Over the next year the Group attended events including the Burren Winterage School and the Who Cares for the Uplands conference organised by the Irish Uplands Forum. We learned about HNV Farming, Locally Led Agrienvironment Projects, Ecosystem Services and Public Goods and understood that our farmers produced goods which were valued by society but which could not be sold at the mart. That the farming system in the Blackstairs was responsible for the rich biodiversity and beauty of our landscape, providing high quality water supplies to surrounding towns and villages and storing carbon in upland peats. During this period we encountered The European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism. In March 2015 the European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism employed Colin Gallagher as the Forums High Nature Value Ireland Officer and offered technical support to our group to help us develop a locally led project. We were delighted but there was an obstacle. We needed to raise funds to assemble the baseline environmental data required. The composition of our committee was crucial in getting the funding we needed. It contained farmers, both lowland and hill farmers; a local architect who could place funding applications in policy context and who had knowledge of and confidence in community led design processes; two local councillors (elected representatives to local government) who were able to guide us through local administration and direct our funding request to decision makers, and a retired environmental science lecturer with experience and contacts in the field of environmental management. In June 2015 the Blackstairs Farming Group secured the funding required from sources including The Heritage Council and Carlow and Wexford Local Authorities. We then began to plan how to develop from being a small working group to a more representative group spanning two counties. Positive engagement betweenthe Blackstairs Farming Group committee, the project team and the local farming community was prioritised and included in the brief for the selection of the ecology team. The European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism also recognised that communication and engagement were important, and funded the role of a local coordinator to liaise with farmers, stakeholders and funding bodies and to manage the project locally. The project team were in place by mid-June 2015 and comprised Colin Gallagher (European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism High Nature Value Ireland Officer), Dr Mary Tubridy (Ecology Team) and Helena Fitzgerald (Local Coordinator and Blackstairs Farming Group Committee Member). The first project team meeting developed the methodology for the research phase of the project and included a plan for community engagement. This plan was then discussed and agreed by the Blackstairs Farming Group Committee. The research work involved gathering information on farming practices and changes to farming in the Blackstairs through face to face interview with and completion of a questionnaire by Blackstairs hill farmers. The habitat mapping involved field work to establish the extent and condition of habitats within the study area and included a series of farm walks around the mountain range attended by hill farmers and other stakeholders. The Blackstairs Farming Group committee contributed to the project planning phase, suggesting who the project team could make contact with and advising on practical issues like suitable access routes to the mountain. In addition the Blackstairs Farming Group agreed a communications plan which included placing regular project updates on social media (@BlackstairsFarm on Twitter and Blackstairs Farming Group on Facebook) and in local print media such as parish newsletters and newspapers. There was still concern that isolated farmers would not hear about the project, so the project coordinator and Blackstairs Farming Group Committee Members contacted many farmers by phone and text message to share information on the project and to encourage attendance at meetings and events. In some cases communication by land line was the only way of making contact with these farmers. In addition the project coordinator identified and contacted other stakeholders including Teagasc, Coillte and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. A particular challenge at this stage of the project was the absence of specific detail on what the project would mean for farmers. It was explained that the process was farmer-led and would reflect the issues farmers themselves identified as being important, however this approach was not a familiar one and for a period there were concerns that the project had an extremist environmental agenda to remove farmers from the mountain and re-wild. The work of Colin Gallagher was particularly skilful in making it clear that the project had a farming focus and in time concerns abated. A turning point came when hill farmers themselves explained to the concerned farmers that the wildlife and habitats on the hill were there because the hill was farmed, and that the project was working to identify how hill farming could be supported and optimised for the environment and for the farmer. â€œHow can hill farming become more attractive for the young farmer?â€� By September 2015 the information gathering phase of the project was complete and it was decided to hold an information meeting to present the research findings to Blackstairs farmers. At the meeting held in Rathanna on the 9th October and attended by circa 70 hill farmers and other stakeholders, it was unanimously agreed to proceed to the next stage of development of the locally led project. Colin Gallagher presented his analysis of data from the Irish Central Statistics Office which indicated a 50% drop since 1991 in the number of farms in the Blackstairs where the main holder was under 44, with a 50% reduction in sheep numbers over the same period. At the meeting representative farmers from around the mountain joined the Blackstairs Farming Group committee to participate in a series of workshops to further develop the project. â€œI would love to be farming full time or even to make it profitable enough to hand on to the next generationâ€� The project report â€œA Case For a Locally Led Agri Environment Scheme For The Blackstairs, Preliminary Proposalâ€� will be ready in early 2016. This report will shape our submission to Irelands Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine for Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 funding under the locally led measure. The engagement with Blackstairs farmers over the last 9 months, involving over 800 hours of voluntary input by Blackstairs hill farmers has indicated that in addition to the locally led project there is interest in developing other business areas to support the hill farming enterprise, including potentially forming a lamb producer group, developing sustainable tourism products and farm based businesses associated with the management of the mountain. It has also become clear that Blackstairs farmers who have come to project meetings to listen, learn and contribute are keen to innovate and are outward looking; characteristics hill farmers are not usually credited with. The legacy of our project with the European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism is a sense of momentum which we would like to build on as we work towards more sustainable and resilient farming communities in the Blackstairs. Given the rate of decline and the age profile of our farmers, the question is; are we too late?

The home range and resource selection of Dexters (a native breed) in the 462 hectare Mount Brandon Nature Reserve in County Kerry is being investigated. It is a collaborative project between the Institute of Technology, Tralee, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and an organic farmer in west Kerry. In Ireland the uplands (land over 150 m) form our greatest expanses of semi-natural habitats. Almost 29% of the country is considered upland and over 40% of the Natura2000 Network occurs in these areas. Uplands are important areas for conservation, supporting many rare and threatened plant and animal species, and containing up to 14 habitat types listed under Annex I of the Habitats Directive (Perrin et al., 2014). Annex I habitats are of particular community importance and member states are obliged to maintain priority habitats in favourable conservation status. Dingle Dexters in the Kerry uplands The latter half of the twentieth century brought about widespread degradation of Irelandâ€™s upland habitats, due in part to inappropriate gazing regimes (Heritage Council, 1999). Reforms have tried to redress imbalances in the uplands, much of which are deemed to be High Nature Value farmland, using a wide range of measures. However, the conservation status of the majority of designated upland habitats in Ireland is currently assessed to be in poor or bad condition (National Parks and Wildlife Service, 2013). Grazing trials were initiated in 2011 with the Dexters, a small and hardy Irish breed. The cattle, based in the lowlands for much of the year, are brought to the mountain in mid-July and have unlimited access to the 462 hectare site and its range of habitats until October. The research focuses on the four main habitat types available to the cattle; dry heath (145 ha), wet heath (62 ha), blanket bog (71 ha) and wet grassland (14 ha). The higher slopes of the reserve are dominated by montane heath and support an interesting arctic-alpine flora, but these heights (>500 m) are not utilised by the cattle and are not under examination. Control plots were established in each of the main habitats in 2011, prior to the cattle being introduced to the site. Home range and habitat selection studies were conducted between 2013 and 2015, which involved tracking selected animals with GPS collars. These data were used to generate home range estimates and conduct habitat selection analysis. Vegetation and ground beetle (Carabid) sampling was completed each year in order to examine how the grazing impacted habitats and species. The 30 cattle used in this study have set up a home range of approximately 100 ha each season, the size, shape and structure of which has been stable both within and between years. This is probably dependent on the distribution of habitat patches in the reserve, as well as factors such as water availability and ease of access between habitat patches. Habitat selection was significant, with cattle showing most preference for wet grassland patches, and least for blanket bog. Knowledge of the behaviour and grazing preferences of cattle in unenclosed landscapes has potential value for land owners and farmers in the development of grazing prescriptions and management plans for sensitive upland ecosystems. The analysis of vegetation and invertebrate data is ongoing and focusses on relating the intensity of use by the cattle to various elements of biodiversity e.g. species richness and diversity, the response of Molinia caerulea â€˜Purple Moor Grassâ€™ and importantly, the conservation status of the Annex I habitats (sensu Habitats Directive). The project is due for completion in May 2016.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News Catchment Case Study: The River Loobagh Catchment Case Study: The River Loobagh June 01, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , Stories The River Loobagh is a tributary of the River Maigue in County Limerick and has a catchment of approximately 129km2. The Loobagh rises in the Ballyhoura Mountains and flows through the Towns of Kilfinane and Kilmallock before joining the River Maigue south of Bruree. The Loobagh and its tributaries are important salmon spawning waters and also support healthy populations of trout. Water quality in the Loobagh is generally good, particularly since the wastewater treatment plants serving Kilfinane and Kilmallock were upgraded in recent years. However, in August 2014, 70,000 gallons of slurry leaked from a steel slurry tower in to the Loobagh just up-stream of Kilmallock and killed hundreds of fish over several kilometres. While this event was deeply upsetting for the local community, particularly the anglers, a silver lining was that it focused attention on the river and highlighted its potential as a fishery. As a result, the decision was taken to pilot a number of initiatives in this area with a view to developing a model of catchment management which would mobilise the local communities to become stewards of their aquatic resources and allow the river to achieve its potential as a high status water body and thriving fishery. Aims of this pilot To raise awareness of the multiple benefits that healthy waterways offer to all sectors of society and of the ways in which we can all impact water quality as we go about our daily lives; embed the idea that economic, social and environmental sustainability are inextricably linked, and empower communities to manage their rivers in a way that allows them to achieve the benefits they need while at the same time protecting water quality and biodiversity. Educational and Awareness Programme An education and awareness programme called â€œStreamscapes Loobaghâ€�, developed by Coomhola Salmon Trust, was delivered to all of the primary and secondary schools in the catchment and evening sessions were held in three locations for the wider community. The programme was received with huge enthusiasm and the feedback from all those who attended was extremely positive. This pilot was funded by LCCC, however, it is hoped to encourage community groups to organise similar events in the future and to apply for funding under programmes such as Local Agenda 21. Stakeholder Group A stakeholder group has been established with representatives from community groups, farming organisations, the local development company, Coillte, Inland Fisheries Ireland, local councillors and landowners. A study trip was undertaken to the Ballinderry catchment in Northern Ireland to look at the work of The Rivers Trust there. The group felt that the Trustâ€™s model of community involvement in river planning and the co-operative approach to solving water quality issues would be very success in the Loobagh area, but acknowledged that having full time dedicated staff was probably something that would not be possible in the immediate future. In the meantime however, it is hoped to establish a voluntary â€œimplementation groupâ€� which would be a sub-committee of the stakeholder group and which would be positioned to apply to for funding for relevant projects through programmes such as Rural Development Programme, Lottery Funding, Failte Ireland, Local Agenda 21 etc. There are several other initiatives underway in the catchment including: In-stream Works The Local Anglers, with the assistance of Inland Fisheries Ireland, identified in-stream works which would improve the habitat for Salmon and Trout and restore fish numbers after the fish kill. They approached the councillors in the Municipal District of Killmallock-Cappamore who enthusiastically supported the proposals and allocated funds from the General Muncipal Allocation to fund phase 1 of the works. These works included the construction of rubble mats, weirs, gravel beds, thalwegs and other structures to improve the conditions for fish to breed and thrive. The funding was used to purchase stone and gravel and the works were carried out by the OPW under their River Improvements Programme. Riverfly Monitoring Programme The Riverfly monitoring programme is a â€œcitizen scienceâ€� project which has been up and running in the UK for a number of years. It will be trialled in the Loobagh over the coming months. This project will provide training to interested community members, anglers and landowners in a simplified method of biological monitoring, which will allow people to monitor and assess their local rivers and streams. The first training session is scheduled for October this year and has been offered to members of the stakeholder group. If feedback from this group is positive, the programme will be offered to the wider community. Control of Invasive Species One of the issues highlighted by the group at an early stage was the problem of Giant Hogweed along the banks of the Loobagh. It was agreed that a high priority for the group should be to implement a programme to control this weed. Ballyhoura Development Ltd, the local development country has submitted an application for funding under Local Agenda 21, on behalf of the group, to provide training to participants in a local Rural Social Scheme in pesticide use and control of invasive species. If the application is successful, the training will be delivered in early 2016 and the control programme will commence at the start of the growing season. It is envisaged that eradication from the catchment will take between five and ten years. Changing attitudes â€“ engagement and empowerment While the Loobagh project is in its early stages, already there is a perceptible shift in attitude: members of the stakeholder group and community groups in the area are already embracing the challenge and the traditional â€œwhy donâ€™t they do something about the problemâ€� has to become â€œletâ€™s see what we can do about itâ€�! This is the essence of meaningful community engagement and empowerment.

To support sustainable development, UNESCOâ€™s concept of a Biosphere has evolved to include not just areas of ecological value but also the areas around them and the communities that live and work within them. To fulfil these broader management aims for the ecosystem, the Biosphere has now been expanded to cover Dublin Bay, reflecting its significant environmental, economic, cultural and tourism importance, and extends to over 300 km 2 . Over 300,000 people live within this area. All Biospheres have three main goals: Conservation : promoting the conservation of landscapes, habitats, wildlife and cultural values Learning : supporting education and research, for a better understanding of nature and global issues Development : fostering a sustainable economy and society for people living and working in the area Dublin Bay Biosphere contains three different management zones. The core zone comprises protected areas which are managed for the conservation of landscapes and biodiversity. It includes Baldoyle Bay, Irelandâ€™s Eye, Howth Head, North Bull Island, the Tolka Estuary and Dalkey Island and covers 50 km 2 . The surrounding or adjoining buffer zone is managed to support the core zone and research, monitoring, training, education and other environmentally sustainable activities are encouraged here. It comprises 82 km 2 of public and private green spaces such as parks, greenbelts and golf courses. The transition zone is the outer zone, where sustainable social and economic development is strongly promoted. It covers 173 km 2 and includes residential communities, harbours, ports and industrial and commercial areas. Dublin Bay is subject to an existing comprehensive legislative and policy planning framework implemented by all levels of government. The Biosphere designation brings no new regulations; its aims are achieved by people working together. The Biosphere is managed by the Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership, which includes Dublin City Council, Dublin Port Company, DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and the National Parks & Wildlife Service of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. This partnership works with community groups, NGOs, local businesses and schools. A Conservation Programme, a Business Development Plan for sustainable tourism and recreation and a Research and Education Strategy, including a programme of events, will be developed for Dublin Bay Biosphere.

The episode explored some of the issues affecting rivers and communities throughout the country. She followed the water from source to sea, looking at the impacts on the river and the people that rely on it. This episode covered how water is not just essential for our health and quality of life, but how communities all over Ireland rely on the ecosystem services provided by our rivers and streams. The Duhallow community on the Blackwater River understand that the river itself is the lifeblood of their community. These communities way of life relies on the health of the river and they have taken extraordinary steps to protect this river catchment. They know that the economy and livelihoods of this community rely on the water that runs through its heart.

How do we manage our catchments? Where is my local catchment? How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News The Story of the Suir The Story of the Suir September 01, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , Get involved , News , Stories The June 2016 issue of the Catchments Newsletter had several articles telling The Story of the Suir. You can find all of them below, along with additional articles from the Local Authorities Waters and Communities Office who have been working with local communities along the Suir. The Suir catchment is 3500 km 2 in size, rising on the Devilâ€™s Bit Mountain and flowing out to the sea at Waterford Harbour. It supports a population of approximately 200,000 spread across several urban centres and the rural population. The catchment supports a wide range of livelihoods and ecosystem services, but how are the catchmentâ€™s aquatic ecosystems coping with all these activities? Do we have the balance right between living and working in, and maintaining a healthy Suir catchment, and if not, what do we need to do to redress the situation? This question is central to the Water Framework Directive river basin management planning process. Plans are made every 6 years containing actions to enhance and protect water quality and the ecosystems that depend on it. We are currently in the characterisation stage of the 2nd planning cycle which is due to culminate in our 2nd cycle plans being completed at the end of 2017, and implemented between 2018 and 2021. Characterisation of water bodies is a critical element of the work required under the Water Framework Directive, and is about understanding how our catchments work and how human activities impact on water, in order to prioritise appropriate actions that ensure that we do get that balance right. In this 2nd cycle our philosophy is about looking for â€˜the right measure in the right placeâ€™ to achieve the best outcome, which will build on the â€˜one size fits allâ€™ approach of the last cycle. What does the River Suir mean to you? Great turnouts and lively discussions were the order of the day for the recent River Suir community meetings. Over two weeks in July, evening meetings were held at six riverside locations throughout the River Suir catchment, specifically to ask local people â€œWhat does the River Suir mean to you?â€�. The main purpose of the evening meetings was to open out the discussion on the Suir into water quality and other natural water issues, and explore opportunities that the Suir and its tributaries can provide to local communities. Full article by Alan Walsh, Local Authorities Waters and Communities Office, is available at https://stg.catchments.ie/river-suir-mean/ The River Suir has a Green and Blue Future Those who live near the Suir have immediate access to a wonderful resource and there are many who regularly access the river for lifestyle and recreational purposes. Tipperary County Council engaged with these communities through two INTERREG co-funded projects, each of which had a focus on waterways. One of these projects was Green and Blue Futures: The social economy and the management of green infrastructure. This project looked at ways to combine social objectives, such as tackling unemployment and engaging disconnected youth, with environmental activities like protecting riverbanks, controlling invasive species and the productive use of green urban spaces. Social enterprise models were explored which combine a focus on positive social outcomes with a business model to generate income in order to move away from a reliance on grant funding. Full article by Alan Walsh, Local Authorities Waters and Communities Office, is available at https://stg.catchments.ie/river-suir-green-blue-future/ How healthy is the Suir Catchment? In general aquatic ecosystem health in the Suir catchment is fairly good. The majority of surface water bodies were â€œNot at Riskâ€� i.e. are expected to meet their Water Framework Directive objectives, meaning that no further actions are required in addition to the basic requirements of the current regulations and best practice management. Water quality trends are also generally improving across the catchment although there are some key hotspot areas where problems continue to arise. 64 (35%) surface water bodies, including the Suir estuary and 4 small groundwater bodies, were found to be At Risk and will require specific measures to achieve improved water quality outcomes. The vast majority of the water bodies containing the protected areas had also already met their objectives. The most significant water quality issue is excess phosphorus (P) from a variety of sources including human and animal wastes and fertilisers, leading to eutrophication, which is impacting on rivers, lakes and estuaries. The next step is to use the range of tools now available to us, which are described on this page, to help pin down exactly where and what the issues are in the problem areas we have highlighted and identify precisely what needs to be done to resolve them. A collaborative, focussed effort will be needed to tackle the significant pressures identified in the Suir catchment. It will need to involve multiple agencies, including staff from the new Waters and Communities office, and the local landholders. Such a collaborative approach will be essential to achieve that balance that will sustain a productive, yet healthy, Suir catchment for the long term. Full article by Jenny Deakin, EPA Catchments Unit, is available at https://stg.catchments.ie/healthy-suir-catchment/ The Suir Estuary = the canary for its catchment? As the ultimate receptors of all the inputs upstream, the estuarine and coastal areas can tell us a lot about what is happening in the overall catchment. We can use the biological communities to tell us about nutrients in the water, or chemical pollutants. Useful indicators to look at nutrient pressures are the seaweeds. We use the presence and abundance of certain seaweeds, such as sea lettuce, to tell us about the nutrient conditions in the estuary. In areas where nitrogen inputs increase these green seaweeds can grow in huge quantities causing an environmental impact. Other indicators of nutrient pressures are the phytoplankton communities (small plants that grow suspended in the water column) which can change depending on the balance of nutrients coming downstream. In severe cases this can result in large harmful algal blooms that can affect the other marine communities, such as shellfish or the bottom dwelling animals. In the Suir we have seen some disturbances to the marine plants with elevated levels of phytoplankton in the water suggesting that the nutrient conditions are too high. We can use this information, along with the other data from our monitoring programmes, to work out what has to be done to improve the situation. By looking at the estuary and coastal areas we can develop an idea of the sort of changes that need to take place in the whole catchment for improvement across all our waters.

The Office of Public Works also measures river levels and river flows in the catchment for drainage and flood management purposes. The hydrometric gauging station networks in the catchment are complimentary, with data shared between organisations to avoid duplication of effort. All Hydrometic Data is available at www.epa.ie/hydronet Full article by Conor Quinlan, EPA is available at https://stg.catchments.ie/measuring-suir-flows-mountains-sea/ Whatâ€™s living in the Suir? The various uses of rivers can involve conflicting interests and often such uses disrupt the ecology or health of the river. The fact that several of the more important beneficial uses of rivers such as drinking water abstraction, amenity uses like water sports, and waste water disposal are all dependent on biological processes is rarely appreciated. Biological monitoring of Irish rivers and streams was first undertaken in the 1970â€™s and since then has continued on a three year survey cycle.. A total of 215 river sites are surveyed in the Suir catchment alone including 138 biological and 139 chemistry sites. Under the biological programme, the macroinvertebrate fauna (small animals without a backbone that can be seen with the naked eye) and the aquatic plants and algae residing in the river are examined, the species are identified, and their relative abundances are recorded. Using their known sensitivities and tolerances to pollution, biological indices can be applied to the observed data to summarise their ecological condition classifying the river site from satisfactory, that is High or Good condition, to unsatisfactory: Moderate, Poor or Bad conditions. Full article by Catherine Bradley, EPA is available at https://stg.catchments.ie/whats-living-suir-healthy-rivers/ How chemical monitoring of our rivers can help us understand their story â€“ why, what, where and when. Water does not exist in its pure form in the natural environment, it is truly reflective of its surroundings, influenced by where it originates, what it flows over and percolates through. Under natural conditions the chemical characteristics of our water bodies originate from a variety of sources, including leaching of soils, weathering of minerals and atmospheric inputs. These chemicals, in both dissolved and particulate forms, reach the water body via a number of pathways, and in the case of surface water have resulted in a natural background level of chemical constituents in which aquatic biota have developed. Water quality monitoring is fundamental in the management of water resources that support healthy and productive aquatic ecosystems as well as sustainable and healthy water supplies and chemistry monitoring is an integral part of any water monitoring programme.. Monitoring for identified chemical compounds highlights any significant changes or trends that may be evident in water bodies over a period of time. Full article by Kieran Gordon, EPA is available at https://stg.catchments.ie/chemical-monitoring-rivers-can-help-us-understand-story/ Whatâ€™s flowing into the Suir? Results from nutrient load apportionment modelling Where rivers and lakes are impacted by excess nutrients, we need to understand the sources of those nutrients before mitigation measures can be selected. In these areas, modelling can be used in conjunction with knowledge from local authorities and investigative assessments to identify significant pressures that contribute excessive nutrients to surface waters. In the Suir catchment, only a relatively small proportion of the catchment requires a reduction in phosphorus emissions to achieve Good Status. Modelling future scenarios can support catchment scientists and managers in identifying appropriate options for measures. Just as pie making isnâ€™t an exact science, modelling the sources of river nutrients can have errors and unknowns. Nonetheless, we can use these results to help support decision making and the integrated catchment management process and, ultimately, to improve our ecosystems and environment.

To help reduce the amount of investigative assessments required and therefore the time and resources needed, a Catchment Characterisation Tool has been developed to produce Pollution Impact Potential (PIP) maps that show the potential critical source areas for agricultural diffuse nutrients in our water bodies and subcatchments. The Pollution Impact Potential maps rank the relative risk areas for diffuse phosphorus to surface water and diffuse nitrogen to surface and groundwater. These maps are now available to all public bodies on the WFD Application. Full article by Marie Archbold, EPA, is available at https://stg.catchments.ie/water-quality-agriculture-pollution-impact-potential-maps-tool-guide-resources-areas-investigation/ â€œWhat exactly is the situation?â€� â€“ Investigative Assessments can provide the answer After all our scientific monitoring and assessment is completed, we may still not know the precise pressure type and location in order to decide on mitigation measures to improve the water quality. What do we need to do? The answer may be simple in theory, but can be difficult in practice â€“ we walk the stream, putting on our detectiveâ€™s hat, and look for clues using a variety of techniques from different relevant disciplines. We can then pin down the issue(s) of concern, and conclude on what might be done about it. It might be asked, if the answer is that simple, has it not been done before? Well, it has, but resources have not always been available to do all that was needed, using all possible techniques. Also, the background information needed â€“ on the physical setting, hydrochemistry, land-use, etc. â€“ was not readily available until recently with the development of the EPA Water Framework Application. There are two overriding principles: Investigative Assessments follow the Source (or pressure)-Pathway-Receptor (S-P-R) model for environmental management. (These are easy words to write down, but visualising each component, and the connections between them in a 3D landscape, is essential). The level of investigation is proportional to the risk posed. Three levels of assessment are proposed: Desk study, based on existing information, such as in the WFD Application, Google Earth and websites such as www.gsi.ie, www.opw.ie and http://gis.epa.ie/Envision. Field-based assessment, mainly by local authority staff. Specialist input, such as from hydrogeologists, agricultural scientists and biologists.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News The development of Rivers Trusts in Ireland The development of Rivers Trusts in Ireland June 02, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , Get involved , News , Water and Communities Rivers trusts are charities, established by local people to look after, protect and improve rivers, streams and lakes in a particular river-catchment or an area comprising many river catchments. As local charities they are often described as having â€œwet feetâ€� because they have the reputation of being â€œdoersâ€�, concentrating their effort on practical catchment, river and fishery improvement works on the ground. In the history of almost every trust there has been a key trigger leading to their formation, for example through a concern over the general decline in species and water quality in a river or a pollution incident which resulted in the loss of fish and other wildlife. Such events focus minds and often the decision by local rivers users, landowners and other interested parties, to form a new trust or similar body is often seen as a most appropriate and effective way forward in order to begin the restoration of the river. There are already a number of rivers trusts established or are forming across Ireland. The Slaney Rivers Trust, Nore Suir Rivers Trust and Blackwater Rivers Trust are all well-established rivers trusts making a difference to the health of the rivers in their catchments. The Waterville Lakes and Rivers Trust in County Kerry, Maigue Rivers Trust in County Limerick and Inishowen Rivers Trust in County Donegal are all in the process of forming. These trusts join the 7 established rivers trusts in Northern Ireland, 44 in England and Wales and 25 rivers and fisheries trust in Scotland â€“ a network with a vast wealth of knowledge and expertise in river conservation and management and who are always happy to help each other. The Department of Environment, Communities and Local Government (DECLG) and the newly formed Local Authority Water and Communities Office (LAWCO) are keen to see the development of rivers trusts across Ireland. The Department has provided funding to The Rivers Trust (the umbrella body for rivers trusts www.theriverstrust.org ) to support the role of the All-Ireland Development Officer â€“ Mark Horton, who is based at, and manages, Ballinderry Rivers Trust in County Tyrone. Mark is on hand to offer advice and support to groups who are interested in forming a rivers trust in their area. Talks can be provided to groups on what rivers trusts are, the work they are involved in and how they form, as well as support and guidance in then setting up a rivers trust as a charity. If you would like to find out more about rivers trusts contact Mark Horton (All-Ireland Development Officer) on 00 44 28 867 61515 or e-mail mark@theriverstrust.org , or contact the Waters and Communities Office on info@lawco.ie Article by Mark Horton, All-Ireland Rivers Trust Development Officer Related Posts Catchment Case Study: The River Loobagh The River Loobagh is a tributary of the River Maigueâ€¦ ""Plight of the Pearls""- Young Scientists look at Pearl Mussels in the River Allow This January, my project partner Riona Sheahan and I enteredâ€¦ About author EPA Catchments Unit Administrator The EPA Catchments Unit is based in Dublin, and the team is involved with catchment science, chemistry, ecology, hydromorphology, modelling, Geographic Information Systems and planning.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Catchment News Home News Locally Led Agri-environment Schemes: Innovation, partnership, locally adapted and results orientated solutions Locally Led Agri-environment Schemes: Innovation, partnership, locally adapted and results orientated solutions June 01, 2016 by EPA Catchments Unit | in Catchment Management , Get involved , News Irelandâ€™s Locally Led Agri-environment Scheme (LLAES) proposals in our current Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 have significant potential to bring innovative solutions to bear to ensure sustainable land management. It is specifically targeted at meeting the requirements of EU Birds, Habitats and Water Framework Directives and has a total budget over the programme period of â‚¬70 million. The LLAES measure is included in the RDP to complement the national level Green Low-Carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) which is a traditional action based approach which pays farmers to undertake particular actions which are linked to cross-cutting objectives of climate change, water quality and biodiversity. The LLAES aims to address particular environmental and biodiversity challenges not addressed at national level by GLAS. It is envisaged that this will include both schemes addressing centrally identified priorities, and also an open competitive call. All priorities will be linked to implementation of the Birds, Habitats and Water Framework Directives. The centrally identified priorities include the continuation of the successful BurrenLIFE programme, priority pearl mussel catchments, and hen harrier areas. LLAES should encourage locally driven solutions and will require submission of proposals by local groups accompanied by detailed estimates of costs. The only current theme identified for the competitive call in the RDP is the conservation/restoration of upland peatlands. At the moment it looks like there will be LLAES developed for the Burren; Freshwater Pearl Mussel Catchments; Hen Harrier Area and Upland Peatlands. The detail of how the LLAES measure will operate is not yet finalised apart from the Burren scheme. Looking at the Burren together with the overview of the LLAES measures available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine gives us some pointers on how other locally led schemes might operate. BurrenLIFE takes a farmer led approach where the farmer nominates and co-funds conservation actions on their farm, giving them the freedom to farm. This is similar to the traditional action based approach of GLAS but what makes the Burren different it that it combines these actions with a results based payment. To ensure that the desired results are achieved payments are made to farmers based on the environmental condition of their farm. Essentially each field gets a quality score and farmers who deliver the best environmental outcomes receive the highest payments. This innovative programme is held up as an example across the EU of how results based agri-environment schemes can work . Key to its development and success has been the local partnership approach where farmers, NGOs, state agencies and government departments came together to find locally tailored and practical management solutions. This partnership is solidified in the implementation of the scheme where the farmers tailor the scheme to their farms and are supported by a dedicated project team, steering group and farm advisors. A partnership approach will be key to the success of other LLAES over the next 5 years. The partnership approach works and is needed to secure stakeholder involvement and bring together the range of expertise to develop and implement the scheme. Through the development of the partnerships dedicated community champions will emerge that will take the initiative and drive innovation. There are currently a number of groups around the country setting up local partnerships and the prospect of a LLAES is a welcome catalyst for the development of such partnerships. The development of these local partnerships can be an opportunity for farmers and the wider community to come together. Supported by government departments and agencies these groups have the potential to achieve the sustainable management of natural resources at local level. Locally-led Schemes â€“ A suggested 10 step plan Below is a suggested 10 step plan to develop a LLAES proposal that may be useful to local groups interested in LLAES. As can be seen local partnerships will need considerable support to develop meaningful proposals. Emerging groups should be supported as LLAES have significant potential to develop results orientated and innovative solutions. Steps Considerations 1. What is the environmental/biodiversity goal for your area? Current priorities = Hen Harrier, Pearl Mussel Catchments and Upland Peatlands. Set goals related to yours selected priority 2. What is the environmental baseline? What is the current state of the target for your area? Use existing information where possible. 3. What is already paid for in GLAS? LLAES must be additional to GLAS, double payment is not allowed. 4. Define specific target and location What is your specific target in terms of land type and location? Should be informed by step 2. 5. Start developing proposals At this stage the local group should assess if it has the expertise and resources to develop programme. Identify if there is local support available? 6. Build understanding of the relationship between farm management and your environmental target What are the qualities of a field/farm that provide the optimum conditions to achieve your environmental goal. Can a set of costed actions be developed that are linked to the achievement of optimum condition? 7. Development of indicators of success Can a simple set of variables be selected that can be used to measure the delivery of the required result for the environment? Used as a basis for payment for result. 8. Are landscape-scale measures required? Is there a need for groups of farmers to work together to deliver the required results? If desired this will add additional complexity that needs to be taken into account in scheme design. 9. Identification of institutional capacity to deliver Need to ensure sufficient resources (financial and staff) will be available for ongoing implementation, monitoring and evaluation if proposal is successful. Ensure running costs are built into proposal. 10. Draft proposal developed and ready for call. Includes: Scheme outline for area covering geographical extent; Target species/habitats; Scheme requirements; Detailed costings including resource requirements for ongoing implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

Through a series of literature reviews, benchmarking with other Member States, data collection and analysis, fieldwork and consultation with river management experts; recommendations have been made on the key elements that contribute towards an overall management framework for Freshwater Morphology, and inform River Basin Management Plans. The key elements are as follows: Classification and Monitoring Risk Assessment Programmes of Measures for Morphology Morphological Assessment for WFD is undertaken with the objective of classifying waterbodies as high, good, moderate, poor, or bad morphological status. The morphological status of a surface waterbody should support ecological status. In accordance with WFD, a waterbody cannot be classified as high ecological status, if the morphology status is not high. Therefore morphological assessment is an important part of the overall classification process. Prior to the introduction of the WFD, classification and monitoring of morphological condition was not systematically undertaken in Ireland. Therefore a methodology had to be established to provide a field survey and associated scoring system to allow classification of morphology in terms of WFD status. The main output of this is determining if morphology status supports overall High Ecological Status. It is also important in confirming impact of morphology pressures acting on waterbodies.

This analysis of water use forms part of an initial characterisation report required by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) that is being prepared by the relevant local authorities in relation to each River Basin District (RBD) and overseen at the national level by the DEHLG and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose of this report is to make use of currently available information to provide an initial overview of the current and projected future economic benefits and costs associated with the utilisation of water resources in Ireland. The Project commenced on 29th April 2004 and was completed on 22nd October 2004. It is intended that this report will provide the foundation for the economic component of the summary national characterisation report due to be presented to the commission of the European Union (EU) by the EPA by 22nd March 2005, under Article V of the WFD. It is also intended that each RBD will use the relevant sections of this report to fulfil the economic analysis requirements associated with RBD-level characterisation reporting. To facilitate this process, economic characteristics of Irelandâ€™s RBDs are collectively and comparatively discussed in Section 3.2, and individual economic profiles for each RBD are attached in Appendix B. Where international RBDs are mentioned, it is the portion of that district which falls in the Republic of Ireland to which this report refers. This analysis does not purport to be a complete and final statement of the economic role of water resources in Ireland. In common with the entire WFD characterisation process, it is an attempt to collate readily available data upon which the best analysis possible at this early stage of WFD implementation can be conducted. Findings Findings in this study are reported for the Republic of Ireland as a whole and for each of its RBDs in four general categories: water use benefits water services costs and costs recovery environmental/resource costs projections of demand, supply, and costs of water services File Action Review of Water Resource Benefit Values - Draft Reportv5.pdf Download Economic Analysis of Water Use.pdf Download Download About author EPA Catchments Unit Administrator The EPA Catchments Unit is based in Dublin, and the team is involved with catchment science, chemistry, ecology, hydromorphology, modelling, Geographic Information Systems and planning.

The pressure on groundwater is described as widespread in the Water Framework Directive National Summary Characterisation Report of 2004. With regard to surface water, the relative contribution of unsewered systems in terms of nutrient load amounts to 3% for nitrate and 7% for phosphorous, while pathogens have been identified as a particular risk. With over 400,000 unsewered systems in use in Ireland and an estimated 200,000 wells and springs, the prevention of contamination of drinking water from on-site sewage effluent is of critical importance. A key factor is to have a consistent approach across River Basin Districts to planning, site evaluation and assessment, use of guidance and certification of approved systems on installation.

To meet this requirement, it is envisaged that a number of initiatives will need to be undertaken to upgrade existing water bodies. The WFD requires the use of economic analysis in making choices between alternative initiatives and in justifying, where appropriate, either a deferral of achievement of the good status objectives or the adoption of a target below good status. Economic analysis often puts monetary values on benefits arising from initiatives, and by contrasting these with the cost of the initiatives, reaches a view as to whether the initiatives are justified in economic terms. In the context of the WFD, this would require ascribing values to water resource benefits. The estimation of water resource benefit values is a substantial research activity internationally, although to date such values have been used relatively infrequently in Ireland. The purpose of this review was to establish the degree to which such water resources values are available, both nationally and abroad, and to evaluate the robustness of these figures and their transferability to specific Irish conditions.

The exemptions are based on the Water Framework Directive objective setting decision tree. The development of extended deadlines was undertaken under the review and guidance of several organisations. Consultations were held with: National Advisory Committee Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government National Parks and Wildlife Service Environmental Protection Agency Office of Public Works Teagasc Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food The purpose of consultations was to ensure the scientific robustness of the technical decisions made, and to ensure that the extended deadlines do not impinge on the achievement of objectives under other environmental legislation. The following cases for extended deadlines are presented in this report: Wastewater treatment plant discharges; Mines and Contaminated Lands â€“ discharges to groundwaters; Agriculture: Nitrogen losses from agriculture to groundwaters; Agriculture: Phosphorus losses from agriculture to surface waters by runoff Agriculture: Phosphorus losses from agriculture to surface waters via groundwater pathways; Forestry â€“ acidification risks; Chemical pollution and chemical status failures â€“ priority substances and specific pollutants; Morphology â€“ channelisation risks; Morphology â€“ overgrazing risks; Nitrogen losses to estuaries; Delayed recovery of highly impacted sites. Each case is described under the following headings: Pressure / Reason for extended deadline; Precise Type of Exemption being sought (for example technical constraint or physical recovery as per the Decision Tree); Specific Reason for Exemption â€“ this outlines the technical reasons as to why Good Ecological Status is not achievable by 2015; Quality Elements thought likely to fail â€“ based on the technical reasons, this outlines the elements for which GES is unlikely to be achieved by 2015; Date â€“ proposed extended deadline; Conclusion â€“ Case summary; Action â€“ Follow up action required. The exemptions were based on district level analysis of pressure and risk datasets supplemented by cases based on detailed local information brought forward by Local Authorities (which have the responsibility for setting objectives in the River Basin Management Plan under the Water Policy Regulations 2003 (as amended). Note that economic assessment is required where it is necessary to determine whether a particular measure should be applied or whether less stringent objectives or deferred objectives should be set on the basis of disproportionate cost. Guidance on economic assessment and a baseline report on the economic analysis of water use in Ireland are available as economic background documents to river basin management plans on www.wfdireland.ie. Economic analysis has not been used to justify deferral of measures or extension of objectives in the North Western, Neagh Bann, Shannon, South Eastern, South Western and Western River Basin Districts.

The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has promoting the establishment by local authorities of such projects to address all inland and coastal waters and these are been funded under the National Development Plan. The overall objective of River Basin Management Projects is to establish an integrated monitoring and management system for all waters within a RBD, to develop a dynamic programme of management measures and to produce a River Basin Management Plan, which will be updated every six years. Central to the Water Framework Directive is a requirement for Member States to encourage the active involvement of all interested parties in its implementation.

The objectives of the study are as follows: Establish the relationship between morphology characteristics and biological status; Identify what level of morphological pressure is sustainable within a water body; Establish which morphological indicators should be included in TraC monitoring programmes; Identify water bodies where morphology restoration measures are required (linked to HMWB designation process); Identify the available buffer (or capacity) of water bodies in order to prioritise action levels; Prioritise morphology pressures; and Develop a decision support tool for regulators to assess the potential impact of future developments on individual water bodies (i.e. to prioritise activities and establish a tiered assessment system). This study involves all 309 TraC water bodies within the Republic of Ireland (RoI), but was undertaken in parallel to the North-South Share (NS-Share) project to ensure compatibility of methodologies between Northern Ireland (NI) and the RoI.

A River Basin District (RBD) can include several individual river basins or catchments. The River Basin Management Planning process requires the preparation, implementation and review of a River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) over six yearly cycles for each RBD identified. This requires an iterative approach to river basin planning and management that will integrate all relevant factors in addressing the issues pertinent to water quality. There are four main elements of the process: Environmental and economic assessment or â€˜ characterisationâ€™ of the river basin district and the pressures and impacts on the water environment; Environmental monitoring based on river basin characterisation; Setting of environmental objectives; and Design and implementation of a programme of measures to achieve environmental objectives.

How to get involved The Water Framework Directive Maps Data Resources Contact Water Research Home Water Research Irelandâ€™s waters are one of our major natural resources. Plentiful availability of good quality water offers a significant competitive advantage to sectors such as agriculture, industry and tourism. Water is a resource that must be carefully managed, and improving water quality status is a national priority for Ireland. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a statutory role in coordinating environmental research. EPA Researchâ€™s water pillar deals with groundwater, surface water, transitional and coastal water; as well as wastewater, drinking, bathing and shellfish waters. The overall aim of the water pillar is to support relevant water policy and to protect our water environment, contributing to achieving excellent water quality in Ireland. The thematic areas under EPA Researchâ€™s Water Pillar for 2014-2020 will be: Theme 1: Safe Water Theme 2: Ecosystem Services and Sustainability Theme 3: Innovative Water Technologies Theme 4: Understanding, Managing and Conserving our Water Resources Theme 5: Emerging and Cross-cutting Issues It will support the emerging policy & implementation research needs in relation to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), as well as marine research considerations to support to the formulation and implementation of policies.

Dundalk Bay Events: What does your river mean to you? March 09, 2017 by EPA Catchments Unit | in 2nd Cycle 2015-2021 , Catchment Management , Get involved , News , Research , Water and Communities Meetings are being held with communities along the rivers of the Dundalk Bay Catchment. These free events will allow you to share stories, knowledge and ideas, and learn about how you can create a plan for the future of the rivers of Dundalk Bay. This is your opportunity to meet individuals and groups who have an interest in the waters, wildlife and heritage on your doorstep. From the uplands of Cooley, the Big and Flurry Rivers flow to Dundalk Bay; the Cullywater and Castletown flow from South Armagh through Dundalk town; the Fane valley skirts the border making its way through Castleblayney and Inniskeen to the coast at Blackrock. The Glyde rises in the Kingscourt area and meets the Proules from Carrickmacross before advancing to Tallanstown to join the Dee near Annagasson. Nobber streams flow into the Dee then through Ardee to the sea at Annagasson; the White River flows through Dunleer before joining the Dee. Dundalk Bay is a Special Area of Conservation for Bird species and shellfish and as such is very sensitive to changes in water quality. These rivers were the roadways of the Ancient East leaving us with an enviable heritage legacy from the Viking forts and the only castle in Ireland built by a woman, Castle Roche, to the land of legends and Irish chieftans. Today, our waterways are still a most precious resource. Lough Muckno is described as the jewel in the crown of Irish Coarse Angling; the Fane and Castletown are noted for salmon and sea trout. Our waterways provide a home to many of our most iconic bird and wildlife species. Increasingly, communities and tourists are using waterways as blueways for sport and recreation. The water is also an important resource for economic development throughout the catchment with the Fane, Glyde and Dee providing drinking water for most of the population. Dundalk bay is economically important for fishing and as a recreational amenity. We are inviting everyone: individuals, businesses, farmers, interest groups, anglers, clubs and communities to participate in our events: 28 th February 8:00 pm Carlingford Heritage Centre, Carlingford 13 th March 8:00 pm Carrickmacross Workhouse 15 th March 8:30 pm Kingscourt Community Centre 21 st March 8:00 pm Hope Castle Lodge Castleblayney 23 rd March 8:00 pm Market House Dunleer 28 th March 8:00 pm Spirit Store, Dundalk 30 th March 8:00 pm Crossmaglen Community Centre These free events aim to gather peopleâ€™s experiences, memories and ideas in order to create a community vision for the future of local waterways. This new approach called the RIPPLE method will include contributions from local speakers and interactive activities to promote sharing and learning and is guaranteed to be fun. Hosted by the newly established Local Authorities Waters and Communities Office (LAWCO) in order to develop a â€˜visionâ€™ for Dundalk Bay rivers. The Waters and Communities office was set up in 2016 to raise public awareness of our water resources and encourage local communities, public bodies and all stakeholders to work together in the management of our natural waters. Your local Community Water Officer is Gretta McCarron who is looking forward to meeting you at an event near you.

High Nature Value farmland comprises those areas of Europe where agriculture is a major (usually the dominant) land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high level of species and habitat diversity, or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both. A range of European Union (EU) policies are targeted at High Nature Value farmland and all EU Member States are required to identify, monitor and support the ecological and economic viability of High Nature Value farmlands. Despite their important role in the delivery of ecosystem services, many of these areas are under threat from abandonment, intensification and land use change. A broad range of landscape types in Ireland are represented in High Nature Value farmland including extensively farmed uplands, areas of calcareous grassland and limestone pavement, machair/coastal grasslands, the drumlin belt from Clew Bay to Cavan with large areas of wet grasslands, the islands, river floodplains and the Wexford slobs. A national map of High Nature Value farmland likelihood for Ireland at electoral division (ED) scale highlights the varied nature of the agricultural land base. The spatial coincidence of High Nature Value farmland and rivers of good ecological status, and areas with high and very high High Nature Value farmland likelihood, were compared with the distribution of river water bodies of good ecological status (2010â€“2012). Of the assessed river lengths, 63% of the river water bodies at good status and 79% of the river water bodies at high status occurred in areas with high High Nature Value farmland potential. Download the report: http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/research/water/research209.html About the report: EPA-funded research generates a scientific knowledge base to support environmental protection. Projects are carefully targeted to deliver on three key areas: Identifying pressures; Informing policy, Developing Solutions. Identifying Pressures The growing demand for a wide range of public goods and services from land in the context of growing populations and a finite resource base is placing significant pressures on farmers and farmland in Ireland and worldwide. Farmers in Ireland with intermediate quality farmland are similarly confronted by multiple, often conflicting demands, because it can support extensive livestock farming; often has high potential for forestry; contains landscapes valued for their biodiversity, recreation and cultural values; and has potential for renewable energy generation and water provision. Policy objectives for different land use types and the services required from the range of agricultural land use intensities in Ireland need to be much clearer. Scotlandâ€™s recent development of a land use strategy can provide many lessons for Ireland and highlights the challenges in trying to maximise benefits while minimising the trade-offs in the delivery of multiple services (Slee et al. 2014). The complex policy demands coupled with the heterogeneity of the land base further highlights the need for translation of clear national policy into local initiatives. Informing Policy High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) occurs predominantly (though not exclusively) in the west of the country and in upland areas in the rest of the country and has high spatial coincidence with high status water and the head water streams of larger downstream rivers. The management of High Nature Value farmland for biodiversity has the potential to have co-benefits for water quality and quantity (the regulation of flooding and maintaining base flow). Improved co-ordination and spatial targeting of initiatives to High Nature Value farmland could play a major role in meeting both the requirements of the Water Framework Directive and the Birds and Habitats Directives, while delivering other ecosystem services. Developing Solutions Different approaches are required to meet Water Framework Directive targets on High Nature Value farmland compared to intensive farmland. In High Nature Value farmland areas there needs to be a focus on promotion of farming activities that meet water and biodiversity objectives rather than focus on mitigation actions that may be required for activities associated with intensive agricultural practices. A framework needs to be developed which maps out a pathway for the development of integrated approaches for the management of our land, water and living resources to ensure sustainable use. There is a real need to expand the range of locally-led integrated catchment/ landscape management initiatives which aim to simultaneously provide multiple ecosystem services. These initiatives must take a participatory approach which will encourage an innovative network of stakeholders working in partnership to develop locally-adapted and results-orientated solutions. Success factors for local initiatives such as the Burren Programme highlight the need to secure a broad range of stakeholder involvement and the key role of dedicated community â€œchampionsâ€� to take the initiative and drive innovation. A flexible and adaptive management approach which is well researched and knowledge based is needed. This recognises the value of sound science and traditional knowledge. Local initiatives need to be supported by state agencies and government departments with an integrated knowledge transfer/advisory service.

Although current planting tends to occur on better quality land, the majority of Irish forests have historically been planted on agriculturally unproductive land. Much of this unproductive land is in the uplands, such that many Irish rivers either rise in or receive drainage from these upland catchments. While recognising other landuse/catchment pressures, this study aimed to assess the risks of forestry-derived eutrophication and sedimentation to running waters and to identify and quantify the factors that affect these risks.

Human activities have led to deterioration in water quality over many years. The Water Framework Directive was adopted by the EU in order to halt and reverse the decline in water quality. The Directive sets very strict deadlines for meeting water quality objectives, especially in protected areas. This plan sets out how we aim to achieve the objectives of the Directive in the Western River Basin District. Informed by pilot projects from the 1990â€™s and through extensive research carried out since 2003, local authorities have developed this plan to provide an objective scientific approach to meeting the required water standards. In preparing the plan all known pressures on waters have been identified and quantified at the level of individual water bodies. Measures to address the pressures have been examined and the likelihood of water quality recover has been assessed. All public bodies and other stakeholders have been consulted extensively in the process. The planâ€™s targets are ambitious yet they are no more than we are obliged to do by EU and national legislation. Further legislative change may be required to control specific activities. Responsibility for taking measures lies with all public bodies whose activities impact on water quality or who regulate such activities. Local authorities must perform their own activities in a way that will promote achievement of objectives and additionally must carry out a range of environmental monitoring and enforcement activities to ensure that other stakeholdersâ€™ actions will lead to water quality improvements.

The population is high compared with the rest of Ireland and there are several large urban centres, the largest being Waterford City, but 80% of the districtâ€™s population lives in small villages or one-off houses in rural areas. The rich soils of the south east are particularly suitable for agriculture and around half the land is given over to tillage and grassland. The districtâ€™s waters support fishing and boating activities and the coastlines of Wexford and Waterford are popular holiday resorts. Water is critical to the economy of the South Eastern RBD, generating and sustaining wealth through activities such as agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, power generation, industry, services, transport and tourism. However, water is a fragile resource that needs to be protected. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adopted in 2000. It requires governments to take a new approach to managing all their waters: rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, groundwaters, protected areas (including wetlands and other water-dependent ecosystems), estuaries (transitional) and coastal waters. Member states must ensure that their waters achieve at least good status, generally by 2027 at the latest, and that status doesnâ€™t deteriorate in any waters. To achieve good status and preserve the best waters, it is necessary to prepare and implement management plans for those waters. This plan is for the South Eastern RBD. It covers the period 2009â€“2015 and has been prepared in consultation with all stakeholders. It sets out the measures to be taken by all stakeholders and the tools to prioritise the application of available resources to those measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of the directive.

The submissions received on the draft Plan have been reviewed and incorporated in this Final River Basin District Management Plan (The Plan) as appropriate. This Plan draws on the background milestone documents (listed in the bibliography) to describe the actions that are proposed to ensure the necessary protection of our waters between 2009-2015. It represented a major milestone in the implementation of the Directive and follows on from the previous major elements of work described above. It sets out how the aims and objectives of improving and protecting water quality and ecology in the waters of each river basin district could be achieved, by means of a Programme of Measures. This Plan was produced jointly by the local authorities and a project team for the Eastern River Basin District. There are twelve local authorities with lands in the Eastern River Basin District (shown on Map 1.1), and these will be the prime implementing agencies for the actions described in the Plan, although actions will also require the involvement of other state and private organisations. Coordination of these efforts is being developed through an Eastern River Basin District Technical Council which includes all of the local authorities along with agencies responsible for implementing relevant legislation.

In preparing the plan all known pressures on waters have been identified and quantified at the level of individual water bodies. Measures to address the pressures have been examined and the likelihood of water quality recovery has been assessed. All public bodies and other stakeholders have been consulted extensively in the process. The plan targets are ambitious yet they are no more than we are obliged to do under current EU and National legislation. Further legislative change may be required to control specific activities. Responsibility for taking measures lies with all public bodies whose activities impact on water quality or who regulate such activities. Local authorities must perform their own activities in a way that will promote achievement of objectives and additionally must carry out a range of environmental monitoring and enforcement activities to ensure that other stakeholdersâ€™ actions will lead to water quality improvements.

It stretches from the source of the River Shannon in the Cuilcagh mountains in counties Cavan and Fermanagh to the tip of the Dingle peninsula in north Kerry. As well as the natural drainage basin of the Shannon river itself, which drains an extensive area of central Ireland, it also includes coastal parts of Kerry and Clare which drain to the sea. It drains 18 local authority areas and is also an international district as a small portion of County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland drains underground to the source of the Shannon where it rises to the surface at the Shannon Pot in County Cavan. The Shannon IRBD is a largely rural district with many protected sites that depend on water (54% of rivers have protected areas associated with them). Water is critical to the economy of the Shannon IRBD, generating and sustaining wealth though activities such as agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, power generation, industry, services, transport and tourism. However, water is a fragile resource that needs to be protected. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) was adopted in 2000. It requires governments to take a new approach to managing all their waters: rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, groundwaters, protected areas (including wetlands and other water-dependent ecosystems), estuaries (transitional) and coastal waters. Member states must ensure that their waters achieve at least good status, generally by 2027 at the latest, and that status doesnâ€™t deteriorate in any waters. To achieve good status and preserve the best waters, it is necessary to prepare and implement management plans for those waters. This plan is for the Shannon IRBD. It covers the period 2009â€“2015 and has been prepared in consultation with all stakeholders. It sets out the measures to be taken by all stakeholders and the tools to prioritise the application of available resources to those measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of the directive.

Member States must ensure that their waters achieve at least good status by 2015. To achieve good status it will be necessary to prepare and implement management plans for our waters. While work on the Directive requires a considerable amount of technical expertise, it also requires the knowledge, understanding and views of people who use water in their everyday lives, whether theyâ€™re drinking it, fishing, feeding cattle with it, swimming in it, using it in manufacturing or even just walking the dog beside it. The users know their water and what condition it is in, so they can check what the scientists have found so far. The Directive is not just about the environment; an economic analysis of water uses is an essential part of the process. These booklets list the main uses and activities that may be affected by the management plans. Again, usersâ€™ knowledge and understanding can help ensure that all the implications for people and the economy are considered.

A critical element to the successful implementation of the WFD is to improve our understanding of the interaction between the two and flow mechanisms by which groundwaters discharge to surface waters. An improved understanding of the contribution of groundwater to surface water is required for the classification of groundwater body status and the determination of groundwater quality thresholds. The overall aim of this study is to estimate the contribution of groundwater to surface waters, particularly river flows. The results will be used to assist in determining the groundwater quality thresholds for chemical parameters that are linked to surface water body EQS requirements. The annual average groundwater flow component will be used in this case. The results also have a wider application to/in many areas of the WFD. In particular, it will assist in: the prediction of the impact on rivers and lakes from groundwater abstraction; further characterisation of catchment hydrology: results from this study will contribute to studies estimating low flow conditions in ungauged catchments; an improved understanding of groundwater flow in poorly productive bedrock aquifers. This is a difficult study to undertake in an Irish context because the physical settings can be very complex. In many surface water catchments, the groundwater flow regime is heterogeneous, and the aquifers underlying the catchment often comprise a mixture of types. Further, the rainfall is highly variable across the country: the west typically has higher rainfall amounts and more frequent rainfall events than the east of Ireland. Some catchments in the west may have previously experienced few drought conditions, so it can be difficult to identify the component of groundwater flow from the bedrock aquifer in a surface water hydrograph.

They are contained in many everyday products used increasingly in households (for example medicines and cleaning products), industry, forestry, agriculture, small businesses, mines, construction sites and water treatment works. Surface run-off from roads and urban areas can also contain dangerous substances from motor vehicle emission. Objectives of Dangerous Substances Programme of Measures and Standards (POMS) study The key objectives of the Dangerous Substances Usage POMS study are summarised as follows: To establish (via literature review and examination of Irish datasets) the dangerous substances likely to arise in Irish water bodies due to particular human activities. To provide information and/or tools for the ongoing collation of the pressures and sources of dangerous substances in Irish water bodies. To establish a framework for the licensing and control of dangerous substances discharges. To optimise the design of the facility (i.e. point source) and status monitoring programmes to be established in accordance with Article 8 of the WFD. The focus of the Dangerous Substances usage study was on the manufacturing and processing industryâ€™s use of dangerous substances. Investigations were also carried out on the use of dangerous substances in forestry, agriculture and aquaculture.

The climate-check was achieved by: Assessing risk, due to climate change, of not achieving good water status or no-deterioration in water status as a consequence of the identified pressures, such as abstraction. Integrating the impacts of climate change when identifying and appraising the Programme of Measures and proposing appropriate adaptation of actions where necessary. looking for opportunities in the monitoring programme to improve our understanding of climate change trends. Considerable effort is underway to improve our understanding of present changes in climate and of likely changes in the future. Notwithstanding the high levels of uncertainty involved, predictions have been made that allow broad ranges of impacts to be considered. Changes in the next twenty to forty years are more readily identified than longer-term changes that depend on many social and political assumptions. Current predictions for Ireland indicate that climate issues may be relatively significant for measures related to: protected areas and high-status sites, abstractions, and physical modifications to river and marine morphology. Considerations also arise for point-source discharges and diffuse landuse pressures such as agriculture, forestry and unsewered systems. Sensitivity for dangerous substances pressure is likely to be low. The study identified that the Programme of Measures can be flexible and adaptable to potential future climate change, in terms of temperature, storm surge, floods and droughts. In fact, many contribute to national adaptation strategies. The analysis highlights the advantages of an integrated catchment-based approach to water management. It contributes to adaptation strategy and strengthens future science/policy link on climate change and water by identifying research needs, communicating them to the research community and making best use of available research results.

Each RBMP is required to be accompanied by a comprehensive Programme of Measures for waterbodies which will be required to ensure that the WFD key objectives are achieved by 2015. A detailed understanding of the risks associated with all pollution sources in waterbodies is fundamental for the development of a Programme of Measures to remedy such pollution sources. In order to acquire a more detailed understanding of the risks posed by the pollution pressures from urban areas CDM were appointed in December 2005 to undertake an urban pressures study project titled â€œThe Assessment of Urban Pressures in Rivers, Transitional Waters and Ground Waters in Irelandâ€�. The scope of the urban pressures study, which is fundamentally a desktop study, entailed assessing urban pressure risks for the 33 largest urban areas nationally. Urban areas were selected where the population exceeded 10,000 as per the 2002 Census figures.

The original Article V risk assessment that was submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the European Commission (EC) in March 2005 was limited by the availability of pressure information and understanding of environmental fate and transport characteristics of DMOs. The Eastern River Basin District (ERBD) project was subsequently commissioned by Dublin City Council (DCC), on behalf of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DEHLG), to study risk to groundwater in greater detail, with the intent of informing future monitoring needs and a Programme of Measures required by the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD). The basic objectives and tasks of the study were to: Improve the understanding of pesticide-related pressures; Research fate and transport characteristics of commonly used pesticides; In the absence of groundwater monitoring data, develop and implement a risk assessment methodology that captures both the pressure information and incorporates relevant physical factors that control leaching of pesticides from soil to groundwater. For the purposes of the revised risk assessment, DMOs are broadly defined as pesticides. Pesticides are used in a wide array of settings, including agriculture, forestry, transportation, (urban) amenity, and industry. Detailed survey records of pesticide usage in the agriculture and forestry were obtained with the assistance of the Pesticide Control Service (PCS) and Coillte, respectively. Estimates for other sectors, including usage by local authorities, are less satisfactory, and rely on limited records, general literature, and information from interviews. Degrees and patterns of use by non-agricultural and non-forestry sectors therefore remain uncertain. Nonetheless, the available information suggests that the largest quantities of pesticides are used in the agricultural sector for pest and weed control.

For most of its life it is a filter feeder, and large quantities of water are pumped through the animalâ€™s siphons and food particles are trapped and passed to the musselâ€™s mouth. The adult pearl mussel burrows to two-thirds of its shell depth, and is almost sessile in nature, often not moving for 100 years. There are two types of pearl mussels in Ireland, one called Margaritifera margaritifera and the other is the very rare Margaritifera durrovensis , which is only known from the Nore Catchment. The pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera has attracted a lot of interest in recent years due to its interesting ecology, life cycle, ability to produce pearls and, most importantly, its decline which has left the species in danger of extinction. As their name suggests, Margaritifera has the ability to occasionally produce pearls. However, there is currently no sustainable way to extract pearls (Moorkens 2004), and thus pearl fishing is illegal. This was not always the case, when pearl mussel populations were very abundant the pearl fishery was highly prized, and has been cited as the underlying reason for the invasion of Britain by the Romans (Johnston, 1850). When adult numbers were very high in certain rivers, pearls were an important cultural aspect of the river (Lucey 2005). Populations of Margaritifera margaritifera are known from North America, northern, western and central Europe and Russia. The species is in very serious decline throughout its range and is listed in the IUCN red data book as endangered worldwide. These plans for Irish Freshwater Pearl Mussels were prepared as part of the 1st Cycle of River Basin management Plans for 2009-2015.

The programme is set out in detail in the report. The programme lists the specified authorities to implement the monitoring programme and there is a statutory obligation on the nominated authorities to execute the monitoring assigned to them. The principal rationale determining the assignment of a particular monitoring responsibility to a Public Authority was the established expertise, competency and capacity of the particular Public Authority to perform the task. For the majority of the biological, hydromorphological and physicochemical parameters, the assigned Public Authorities have been involved in the assessment of these parameters for several decades. Due to a lack of existing capacity and expertise within the Public Authorities in Ireland, a small amount of the biology and hydromorphology as well as a significant amount of the chemical monitoring may need to be outsourced, at least for an initial period. For practical purposes it is desirable that the outsourcing be as centralised as possible. With this in mind it is proposed that the EPA arrange and manage the outsourcing in freshwaters and the Marine Institute the outsourcing of samples from transitional and coastal waters. The structure and content of the monitoring programme represents the outcome of a major research and development process involving various sub-groups under the auspices of the National Technical Co-ordination Group for the WFD and the outcome of the consultation process referred to above. As required by the Regulations, the programme sets out the â€˜nature, frequency and extentâ€™ of the monitoring to be implemented, to be operational 22 December 2006. While the development of the programme has considered monitoring requirements at water body level, the listings of stations as set out in the report on the proposed programme are indicative, and will be subject to amendment periodically based on experience and on new developments, while keeping to the overall nature, frequency and extent of the programme as set out in this report.

These environmental objectives and the measures required to achieve them are to be identified and presented in individual River Basin Management Plans. An essential step in this process will be the classification of the status of all waterbodies which in turn will assist in identifying the objectives that must be set in the individual RBMPs.

It is the most recent in the series of comprehensive three-year reviews of water quality in Ireland that have been undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its predecessor organisations. The purpose of the report is to give a detailed review of all the main issues related to the quality of the aquatic environment in Ireland, in order to provide guidance towards the protection and enhancement of this valuable resource, and the preparation of second cycle river basin management plans under the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). The report is based on monitoring carried out at: 336 groundwater monitoring sites (covering approximately 69,000 km2) 3,051 river monitoring sites (covering approximately 13,300 km of river channel length) 42 canal monitoring sites (covering approximately 332 km of channel) 213 lakes (covering approximately 955 km2 of lake surface area) 9 heavily modified water bodies (covering approximately 37 km2) 193 transitional water bodies (covering approximately 844 km2), and 101 coastal water bodies (covering over 13,000 km2). These water quality datasets have been generated by the EPA, local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland, Waterways Ireland, the Marine Institute, as well as from other State agencies, such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Irish Coast Guard. The initial focus of the report is on the status of waters as defined under the Water Framework Directive. However, the report also contains more in-depth analysis of the underlying environmental indicators that determine status, including their trends. These environmental indicators are particularly important for identifying the causes of environmental impacts and for guiding the appropriate management measures for the restoration and protection of waters. The environmental indicators of the quality of Irelandâ€™s aquatic environment reported include; ecological assessments, nutrient levels and trends, reported fish kills, the quality of shellfish waters, faecal contamination of groundwater, levels of radioactivity in marine waters, oil pollution incidents in marine waters, and the presence and levels of toxic substances in the aquatic environment.
